<H1> Unicode</H1>

   
<P> Personal computers originally only support a small set of human-readable characters. 
  These were part of a set of 128 characters, among which the basic alphabet in 
  lower and upper case, numbers 0 through 9, some punctuation marks, and some 
  control characters.</P>
<P>An additional 128 characters became available that have throughout the world 
  been used for small localised character sets. StageRace 2003 already supported 
  a number of these character sets (iso-8859, Windows-125x and Windows-874).</P>
<P>Unicode is a much more recently established set that consists of many thousands 
  of characters, supporting all locally used characters at once, and is typically 
  two-bytes per character. As per the 2005 version StageRace fully supports Unicode. 
  This means that the data you input to StageRace can be any Unicode character 
  and all output is Unicode.</P>
<P>You can select in the <a href="Settings%20HTML.html">HTML settings</a> if full 
  documents must be in Unicode or that only non-ANSI characters must be encoded 
  in the HTML. Only events that typically have many non-ASCII characters (e.g. 
  in their <a href="MultiLanguage.html">MultiLanguage database</a> or in their 
  competitors and teams lists) should use full Unicode documents. Because of the 
  two-byte nature of Unicode, full Unicode documents are typically around double 
  the size.</P>
<P>A few exceptions on Unicode support exist:</P>
<ul>
  <li>The e-mail body of e-mails sent through the <a href="Event%20items%20selection.html"><span class="screenquote">Event 
    items selection</span> dialog</a> will be encoded in non-Unicode; and</li>
  <li>The language identifiers for <a href="MultiLanguage.html">multi-language 
    strings</a> can only exist of characters ranging A-Z and 0-9.</li>
</ul>

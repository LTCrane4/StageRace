      Clipboard 
   </H1>

   <P>
      StageRace supports copy, cut and paste for both competitors and teams. Therefore 
      the following description applies to the 
      <A HREF="Competitors%20view.html">
         competitors view</A> and the 
      <A HREF="Teams%20view.html">
         teams view</A>.</P>

   <H2>
      Copy 
   </H2>

   <P>
      Select the competitors or teams that you want to copy to the clipboard. 
      Then choose <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">Copy</SPAN> from the <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">Edit</SPAN> 
      menu.</P>

   <H2>
      Cut 
   </H2>

   <P>
      Select the competitors or teams that you want to copy to the clipboard. 
      Then choose <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">Cut</SPAN> from the <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">Edit</SPAN> 
      menu.</P>

   <P>
      Cut competitors or teams will immediately be deleted from the particular 
      list. However, they are not deleted when they are <em>used</em>. Used for 
      competitors means being ranked in any stage. Used for teams means being 
      used by competitors.</P>

   <H2>
      Paste 
   </H2>

   <P>
      Choose <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">Paste</SPAN> from the <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">Edit</SPAN> 
      menu. The contents on the clipboard is used as competitors or teams, depending 
      on whether the pasting is done in the 
      <A HREF="Competitors%20view.html">
         competitors view</A> or the 
      <A HREF="Teams%20view.html">
         teams view</A>.</P>

   <P>
      StageRace can not always determine if the clipboard actually consists of 
      the right type (either competitors or teams). Be careful not to past competitors 
      in the teams view and vice versa.</P>

   <P>
      Note that pasting a large amount of competitors or teams can take a while. 
      Your system is not hanging, it is just busy.</P>

   <P>
      Before pasting a confirmation is being asked for.</P>

   <P>
      Competitors or teams with the same start no. or team code will be overwritten 
      when pasting.</P>

   <P>
      The following paragraphs only apply to pasting competitors.</P>

   <H3>
      Teams while Pasting Competitors 
   </H3>

   <P>
      While pasting competitors the team codes or names that are included will 
      be used to:</P>

   <UL>
      <LI> Look up existing teams and link them to the pasted competitors; and</LI><LI>Create 
      new teams when necessary.</LI>
   </UL>

   <P>
      If teams are created in this way, the 
      <A HREF="Team%20dialog.html">
         <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Team properties</SPAN> dialog window</A> is 
      displayed for every team, to allow you to enter the team details.</P>

   <P>
      However, in the confirmation that is asked for (before pasting, as mentioned 
      above) you can choose to suppress this. StageRace will then use its own 
      propositions for team code and name without asking you.</P>

   <P>
      However, when the latter would result in double team codes being created, 
      StageRace will again ask for the user to change the team code.</P>

   <H3>
      <A NAME="pastewithstartno">
      </A>Competitors without Start Nos. 
   </H3>

   <P>
      Through <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">Paste with start nos.</SPAN> in the <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">Edit</SPAN> 
      menu you can choose to ignore the start numbers that might be included in 
      the competitors information that you are pasting. This way the information 
      is pasted as 
      <A HREF="Competitors%20and%20teams.html#sparecompetitors">
         spare competitors</A>.</P>

   <P>
      If you do not include start nos. in the information that you want to paste, 
      StageRace is likely to automatically detect this. It will then automatically 
      paste your information as 
      <A HREF="Competitors%20and%20teams.html#sparecompetitors">
         spare competitors</A>, no matter what <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">Paste with 
      start nos.</SPAN> is currently set to.</P>

   <P>
      Note that if <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">Paste with start nos.</SPAN> is switched 
      off, the competitor nos. in the competitors view are grayed out, to indicate 
      the setting.</P>

   <H2>
      Other Applications 
   </H2>

   <P>
         Except for clipboard support within StageRace (i.e. between two different 
         event files) you can also transfer competitors from and to many other 
         programs, such as Office applications like Word, Excel or Access.</P>

   <P>
      To do this, the data has to be ordered in a table and should have the following 
      order:</P>

   <P>&nbsp;
   </P>

   <TABLE BORDER="0" CELLSPACING="0" CELLPADDING="5">
      <TR>
         <TH> 
         <P>
            For competitors</P>

         </TH><TH> 
         <P>
            For teams</P>

         </TH>
      </TR>

      <TR>
         <TD>
            <UL>
               <LI> Start no.</LI><LI> Name</LI><LI> Team name or code</LI><LI> 
               Country code</LI><LI> UCI code</LI><LI> License</LI><LI> Category</LI><LI> 
               Mask 1</LI><LI> Mask 2</LI><LI> Mask 3</LI>
            </UL>

         </TD>

         <TD>
            <UL>
               <LI> Code</LI><LI> Name</LI><LI> Manager</LI><LI> Country </LI>
            </UL>

         </TD>

      </TR>

   </TABLE>

   <P>&nbsp;
   </P>

   <P>
      For quick reference, remember that these orders correspond to those in the 
      <A HREF="Competitor%20dialog.html" CLASS="screenquote">
         Competitor properties</A> and 
      <A HREF="Team%20dialog.html">
         <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Team properties</SPAN></A> dialogs.</P>

   <P>
      This is the format as it is used when copying or cutting from StageRace. 
      If you want to paste to StageRace, you should use the same order, but:</P>

   <UL>
      <LI>Columns can be omitted at the end;</LI><LI>Columns can be left empty; 
      and </LI><LI>The <SPAN CLASS="screenquote"> Start nos.</SPAN> column can 
      be omitted entirely as described before, in case spare competitors are involved.</LI>
   </UL>

      <P>
         Note that if you want to paste StageRace competitors or teams in Microsoft<SUP>&reg;</SUP> 
         Word, and you do not want to lose the tabular form, you should already 
         make a table in Word and select the appropriate cells before pasting. 
         Otherwise Word will paste the competitors as ordinary text lines while 
         separating their columns with tab characters.</P>

      Competitors from Scan'O'Vision can be imported in StageRace so they can

   <H2>
      Introduction 
   </H2>

   <P>
   </P>

   <P>
      Omega<SUP>&reg;</SUP> Electronics is part of the world famous watch manufacturer 
      and is among other things specialized in the development of top-end equipment 
      for sports timing.</P>

   <P>
      One of Omega<SUP>&reg;</SUP> Electronics' products is the Scan'O'Vision 
      finish camera.</P>

   <P>
      The StageRace program has been made capable to import files from Scan'O'Vision.</P>

   <H2>
      Data Handling 
   </H2>

   <H3>
      Importing 
   </H3>

   <P>
      Under the name <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Data Handling</SPAN>, the Scan'O'Vision 
      software works with a number of text files, which consist of competitors 
      information and classifications. Data Handling files can typically be found 
      in the <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">\osvcolor\dh</SPAN> folder.</P>

   <P>
      To configure the <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Data Handling</SPAN> in Scan'O'Vision, 
      please refer to the appropriate documentation. </P>

   <P>
      To import start numbers and timing results, the file <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">LstRslt.txt</SPAN> 
      is of interest. The file is composed as follows.</P>

   <P>
   </P>

   <P>
      <B></B>The file's first line has a description of the fields. All following 
      lines correspond to the results of one single competitor at one particular 
      measurement point.</P>

   <P>
      Ergo, the file can consist of classifications of multiple measurement points 
      ("events"). Thus one <EM>event</EM> will have to be chosen before importing.</P>

   <P>
      Next, every line consists of:</P>

   <UL>
      <LI> Event number</LI><LI> Round, heat and lap</LI><LI> Competitor's number</LI><LI> 
      Lane and status</LI><LI> Time in units</LI><LI> Formatted time in <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">hh:mm.ss.tttt</SPAN> 
      of which accuracy and rounding depend on Scan'O'Vision settings</LI>
   </UL>

   <P>
      The only fields of interest for StageRace are event number, round, heat, 
      competitor's number and time in units. The event number, round and heat 
      are used in the 
      <A HREF="Control%20import%20classification%20dialog.html">
         <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Control import classification</SPAN> dialog</A> 
      to determine which competitors to include during import.</P>

   <P>
      Time in units means that the time is expressed in a multiple of 1/1000ths 
      of a second. This time format is difficult to read, but is used often as 
      an inter-system communication format.</P>

   <P>
      Within StageRace, the 
      <A HREF="Arrival%20tab%20sheet.html">
         <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Arrival</SPAN> tab</A> provides file import. 
      In the <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Import classification</SPAN> file dialog 
      the text file that contains the classification data can be picked. Additionally, 
      the file type in this dialog should be set to <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Omega 
      Scan'O'Vision data handling</SPAN> so that StageRace can retrieve the appropriate 
      settings for the advanced 
      <A HREF="Control%20import%20classification%20dialog.html">
         <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Control import classification</SPAN> dialog</A>. 
   </P>

   <P>
   </P>

   <P>
      To configure the Data Handling in Scan'O'Vision, please refer to the appropriate 
      documentation.</P>

      Example

      <P>
         A typical file looks like this:</P>

      Importing 
   </H3>

   <P>
      Besides the Data Handling functionality, also classification files (<SPAN CLASS="screenquote">.cl</SPAN>) 
      from Scan'O'Vision can be used for the transfer of results to StageRace. 
      The important disadvantage of these files is the layout being dependent 
      on view settings inside Scan'O'Vision. Therefore, the layout of these files 
      is very varying and so they have to be imported through the 
      <A HREF="Control%20import%20classification%20dialog.html">
         <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Control import classification</SPAN> dialog</A>.</P>

   <P>
      Within StageRace, the 
      <A HREF="Arrival%20tab%20sheet.html">
         <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Arrival</SPAN> tab</A> provides file import. 
      In the <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Import classification</SPAN> file dialog 
      the text file that contains the classification data can be picked. Additionally, 
      the file type in this dialog should be set to <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Omega 
      Scan'O'Vision formatted results</SPAN> so that StageRace can retrieve the 
      appropriate settings for the advanced

      documentation.</P>

      Half Stages

   <P>
      An event is divided into 
      <A HREF="Full%20stages.html">
         full stages or days</A>. Next, every such 
      <A HREF="Full%20stages.html">
         stage</A> consists of one or more half stages.</P>

   <P>
      A half stage is the only thing in StageRace that actually requires competitors 
      to do any work; it represents them riding from A to B (or from A to A, for 
      that matter).</P>

   <P>
      A half stage can optionally be a 
      <A HREF="Time%20trials.html">
         time trial</A>.</P>

   <P>

      <A HREF="Event%20tree.html">

      It is not possible to insert new half stages between existing half stages

   <P>
      A half stage that is selected in the

      The <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Half stage settings</SPAN> dialog for an existing 
      stage can be accessed through <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">Configure selection...</SPAN>

      Main Settings 
   </H3>

   <P>
      The following parameters can be entered:</P>

   <UL>
      <LI CLASS="li_extensive"><SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Title</SPAN><BR> Enter 
      the title of the half stage. <BR> Often the start and finish locations of 
      the particular half stage are entered, e.g. &quot;Maastricht-Maastricht&quot; 
      or &quot;Paris-Roubaix&quot;.</LI><LI CLASS="li_extensive"><SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Opening 
      hour</SPAN><BR> Enter the starting time of the half stage.<BR> Note that 
      this is an informational field and is not used in any calculations.</LI><LI CLASS="li_extensive"><SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Distance: 
      ... rounds of ... meters</SPAN><BR> Enter the number of rounds and the distance 
      per round.<BR> The number of rounds should always be one or more. Therefore, 
      with city-to-city events the number of rounds is normally one exactly and 
      the total distance will be entered directly as it is.<BR> For time trials 
      the number of rounds is forced to one.<br> What you enter is always interpreted 
      as a <em>meters</em> value. Even if you choose to print only <em>miles</em> 
      values on 
      <a href="Settings%20publication.html">
         publications</a>, you still have to enter values in meters here.</LI><LI CLASS="li_extensive"><SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Time 
      trial</SPAN><BR> Set the half stage to be a 
      <A HREF="Time%20trials.html">
         time trial</A>. Additionally choose the type of 
      <A HREF="Time%20trials.html">
         time trial</A>: 
      <UL>
         <LI CLASS="screenquote">Input net times</LI><LI CLASS="screenquote">Input

      </UL>

      </LI><LI CLASS="li_extensive"><SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Exclude from general</SPAN><BR> 
      Set the half stage arrival not to be added to the general classification 
      and the cumulative distance. This is useful for 
      <A HREF="Team%20time%20trials.html">
         team time trials</A>. Note that bonus seconds etc. are nevertheless counted 
      as before.</LI><LI><SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Only count deciding competitor 
      towards teams classification</SPAN><BR> Set the teams classification only 
      to use the competitor that in the 
      <A HREF="Settings%20ranking.html">
         <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Ranking</SPAN> section of the settings dialog</A> 
      is set as the deciding competitor. This is useful for 
      <A HREF="Team%20time%20trials.html">
         team time trials</A> that should have every team only count once towards

      Points and Bonus Schemes

   <P>
      For every single half stage you can configure the desired scheme for 
      <A HREF="Bonuses.html">
         bonus seconds</A> that counts towards the general classification and 
      the desired points schemes for

      <A HREF="Points%20classifications.html">
         points</A> and 
      <A HREF="Climbing%20classifications.html">
         climbing</A> classifications. For each of these four points and bonus 
      schemes there exists an extra tab sheet in the <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Half

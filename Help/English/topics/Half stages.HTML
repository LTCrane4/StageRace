      Half Stages 
   </H1>

   <P>
      An event is divided into 
      <A HREF="Full%20stages.html">
         full stages or days</A>. Next, every such 
      <A HREF="Full%20stages.html">
         stage</A> consists of one or more half stages.</P>

   <P>
      A half stage is the only thing in StageRace that actually requires competitors 
      to do any work; it represents them riding from A to B (or from A to A, for 
      that matter).</P>

   <P>
      A half stage can optionally be a 
      <A HREF="Time%20trials.html">
         time trial</A>.</P>

   
<P> A half stage holds at a maximum the following items:</P>

   
<UL>
  <LI>Stage arrival, with <A HREF="Bonuses.html"> bonuses</A> and <A HREF="Corrections.html"> 
    corrections</A>, and for <a href="Time%20trials.html">time trials on gross 
    times</a> sorted an arrival list;</LI>
  <LI>General classification, optionally also sorted on start no.;</LI>
  <LI><A HREF="Masking.html">Masks</A>: 
    <ul>
      <li><a href="Masking.html">Stage classifications</a>; and</li>
      <li><a href="Masking.html">General classifications</a>;</li>
    </ul>
  </LI>
  <LI>Teams classification;</LI>
  <LI> <A HREF="Sprint%20classifications.html"> Sprint classification</A>;</LI>
  <LI> <A HREF="Points%20classifications.html"> Points classification</A>;</LI>
  <LI> <A HREF="Climbing%20classifications.html"> Climbing classification</A>;</LI>
  <LI><a href="Most%20aggressive%20rider%20classifications.html">Most aggressive 
    rider classification</a>;</LI>
  <li><a href="Time%20trials.html">Time trial starting order</a>;</li>

  <LI>Sign outs; and</LI>
  <LI> <A HREF="Time%20trials.html"> </A><A HREF="Communiqu%E9s.html"> Communiqu&eacute;</A>.</LI>
</UL>
<p>Note that often you will just have one single half stage per <a href="Full%20stages.html">full 
  stage or day</a>. For this reason half stage numbering is by default suppressed, 
  except of course for when there actually are more than one single half stage 
  in a <a href="Full%20stages.html">stage</a>. Numbering will be 1, 2, 3-1, 3-2, 
  4, rather than 1-1, 2-1, 3-1, 3-2, 4-1. This can be changed by <a href="Settings%20general.html">general 
  settings</a>.</p>

   <P>
      When a 
      <A HREF="Full%20stages.html">
         full stage</A> is selected in the 
      <A HREF="Event%20tree.html">
         event tree</A>, a new half stage can be added through <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">Half 
      stage...</SPAN> in <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">Insert</SPAN> in the <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">Configure</SPAN> 
      menu. The <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Half stage settings</SPAN> dialog (read 
      below) will appear.</P>

   <P>
      New half stages are added at the end of the list of existing half stages 
      for the particular full stage.</P>

      It is not possible to insert new half stages between existing half stages 
      in the same full stage.</P>

      Deleting 
   </H2>

   <P>
      A half stage that is selected in the 
      <A HREF="Event%20tree.html">
         event tree</A> can be deleted through <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">Delete...</SPAN> 
      in the <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">Configure</SPAN> menu. A confirmation will 
      be asked for after which the entire half stage will be deleted.</P>

   <P>
      The <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Half stage settings</SPAN> dialog for an existing 
      stage can be accessed through <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">Configure selection...</SPAN> 
      in the <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">Configure</SPAN> menu, when the half stage 
      is selected in the 
      <A HREF="Event%20tree.html">

   <H3>
      Main Settings 
   </H3>

   <P>
      The following parameters can be entered:</P>

   
<UL>
  <LI CLASS="li_extensive"><SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Title</SPAN><BR>
    Enter the title of the half stage. <BR>
    Often the start and finish locations of the particular half stage are entered, 
    e.g. &quot;Maastricht-Maastricht&quot; or &quot;Paris-Roubaix&quot;.</LI>
  <LI CLASS="li_extensive"><SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Opening hour</SPAN><BR>
    Enter the starting time of the half stage.<BR>
    Note that this is an informational field and is not used in any calculations.</LI>
  <LI CLASS="li_extensive"><SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Distance: ... rounds of ... 
    meters</SPAN><BR>
    Enter the number of rounds and the distance per round.<BR>
    The number of rounds should always be one or more. Therefore, with city-to-city 
    events the number of rounds is normally one exactly and the total distance 
    will be entered directly as it is.<BR>
    For time trials the number of rounds is forced to one.<br>
    What you enter is always interpreted as a <em>meters</em> value. Even if you 
    choose to print only <em>miles</em> values on <a href="Settings%20publication.html"> 
    publications</a>, you still have to enter values in meters here.</LI>
  <LI><span class="screenquote">Finish deadline</span><br>
    The <a href="Time%20cuts.html">finish deadline</a> for the half stage can 
    be given in a percentage number. A value of 0% signifies no <a href="Time%20cuts.html">time 
    cuts</a> to apply to this half stage.</LI>
  <LI CLASS="li_extensive"><SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Time trial</SPAN><BR>
    Set the half stage to be a <A HREF="Time%20trials.html"> time trial</A>. Additionally 
    choose the type of <A HREF="Time%20trials.html"> time trial</A>: 
    <UL>
      <LI CLASS="screenquote">Input net times</LI>
      <LI CLASS="screenquote">Input gross times</LI>
    </UL>
  </LI>
  <LI><span class="screenquote">Allow late start time changes</span><br>
    Choose if it is allowed for this <a href="Time%20trials.html">time trial</a> 
    to make changes to the <a href="Time%20trial%20starting%20order%20dialog.html">starting 
    order</a> even when already competitors have been ranked. </LI>
  <LI><SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Exclude from general</SPAN><BR>
    Set the half stage arrival not to be added to the general classification and 
    the cumulative distance. This is useful for <A HREF="Team%20time%20trials.html"> 
    team time trials</A>. Note that bonus seconds etc. are nevertheless counted 
    as before.</LI>
  <LI><SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Only count deciding competitor towards teams classification</SPAN><BR>
    Set the teams classification only to use the competitor that in the <A HREF="Settings%20ranking.html"> 
    <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Ranking</SPAN> section of the settings dialog</A> 
    is set as the deciding competitor. This is useful for <A HREF="Team%20time%20trials.html"> 
    team time trials</A> that should have every team only count once towards the 
    teams classification.</LI>
</UL>

   <H3>
      Points and Bonus Schemes 
   </H3>

   
<P> For every single half stage you can configure the desired scheme for <A HREF="Bonuses.html"> 
  bonus seconds</A> that counts towards the general classification and the desired 
  points schemes for <A HREF="Sprint%20classifications.html"> sprint</A>, <A HREF="Points%20classifications.html"> 
  points</A> and <A HREF="Climbing%20classifications.html"> climbing</A> classifications. 
  For each of these four points and bonus schemes there exists an extra tab sheet 
  in the <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Half stage settings</SPAN> dialog.</P>
<h2>Configure All</h2>
<P>Rather than configuring all half stage settings and schemes for one single 
  half stage, you can choose <span class="help_menu">Configure all</span> in the 
  <span class="help_menu">Configure</span> menu so that you can configure a single 
  type of configuration data for all half stages at once, e.g. all half stage 
  settings, or all bonus schemes, et cetera.</P>

      Points Classifications 
   </H1>

   <P>
      For every 
      <A HREF="Half%20stages.html">
         half stage</A> you can set up a scheme of points for the points classification.</P>

   <P>
      Points are awarded for the best riders in the stage arrival.</P>

   <P>
      The sum of these points from every 
      <A HREF="Half%20stages.html">
         half stage</A> will be used to calculate a general individual points 
      classification from.</P>

   <P>
      For points classifications a separate publication is generated, which lists 
      the competitors and their points from the particular 
      <A HREF="Half%20stages.html">
         half stage</A> arrival as well as the general points classification. 
   </P>

   <H2>
      Configuration 
   </H2>

   <P>
      The configuration of points will be done by use of the tab sheet <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Points 
      classification</SPAN> of the 
      <A HREF="Half%20stages.html">
         configuration of the particular half stage</A>. This can be found through 
      <SPAN CLASS="help_menu"> Configure selection...</SPAN> in the <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">Configuration</SPAN> 
      menu, when the appropriate 
      <A HREF="Half%20stages.html">
         half stage</A> is selected in the 
      <A HREF="Event%20tree.html">
         event tree</A>.</P>

   <P>&nbsp;
   </P>

   <P>
      On the tab sheet there is a list <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Finish points</SPAN> 
      to enter the points for the stage arrival. The points in this list correspond 
      to the successive rankings, starting from 1.</P>

   <H3>
      Add 
   </H3>

   <P>
      To add points, the number of points has to be entered in the field above 
      the particular list and <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Add</SPAN> has to be clicked.</P>

   <P>
      There is no real limit to the amount of points entries that you can enter.</P>

   <H3>
      Remove 
   </H3>

   <P>
      If a points entry is selected from the list, it can be deleted by clicking 
      <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Remove</SPAN>.</P>

   <P>
      By entering no points entries at all, the <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Points 
      classification</SPAN> item will subsequently be removed from the 
      <A HREF="Event%20tree.html">
         event tree</A>.</P>

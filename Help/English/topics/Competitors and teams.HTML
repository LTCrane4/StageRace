      Competitors and Teams 
   </H1>

   <P>
      All the competitors that you want to use in 
      <A HREF="Arrivals.html">
         arrivals</A>, must be available on beforehand. So before the finish of 
      the first stage, you should enter all the competitors, using the 
      <A HREF="Competitors%20view.html">
         competitors view</A>.</P>

   <P>
      While doing so, teams should be entered. You can easily do so when every 
      first competitor of each team comes by. But you can also explicitly work 
      with teams through the 
      <A HREF="Teams%20view.html">
         teams view</A>.</P>

   <P>
      Teams that are not assigned to any competitors will obviously not count 
      towards the 
      <A HREF="Rules%20teams%20classifications.html">
         teams classification</A>. In contrary, it is possible to add competitors 
      without a team assigned to.</P>

   
<P> Competitors and teams inputting can be speeded up, using the <A HREF="Clipboard.html"> 
  clipboard</A>.</P>
<P>Typos in competitor and team details can be corrected with the <a href="Cleanup%20competitors.html"><span class="screenquote">Cleanup 
  competitors</span> dialog</a>. </P>

      <A NAME="sparecompetitors">
      </A>Spare Competitors 
   </H2>

   <P>
      The system of <EM>spare competitors</EM> allows for adding competitors to 
      the event file without actually enrolling them in the race.</P>

   <P>
      This means that you can add all the information for a competitor, except 
      for the start no. Such competitor will not be listed on the competitors 
      list nor be available for 
      <A HREF="Arrivals.html">
         arrivals</A>, but is still quickly available &quot;last-minute&quot; 
      for replacing a competitor that was already enrolled.</P>

   <P>
      Note that other competitors than spare competitors are referred to as <EM>active 
      competitors</EM>.</P>

   <H2>
      Masking 
   </H2>

   
<P> Each competitor can be included in any of ten <A HREF="Masking.html"> masks</A> 
  that can be configured.</P>

      Climbing Classifications 
   </H1>

   <P>
      For every 
      <A HREF="Half%20stages.html">
         half stage</A> you can set up a scheme of points for the climbing classification.</P>

   <P>
      Climbing points are awarded for intermediate sprints that specifically take 
      place on hills or mountains.</P>

   
<P> In a climbing classification, the amount of difficulty of the location of 
  the sprint is taken into account. Therefore, for each <A HREF="Half%20stages.html"> 
  half stage</A> you can enter points schemes for up to four normal categories 
  plus a Horse Classe (&quot;HC&quot;), which each correspond to a certain grade 
  of difficulty.</P>

   <P>
      Once you have determined the existing categories for a 
      <A HREF="Half%20stages.html">
         half stage</A> and the matching points schemes, you have to lay down 
      the order in which categories are used.</P>

   
<P> For example, imagine a <A HREF="Half%20stages.html"> half stage</A> using 
  three categories of climbing difficulty. The first climbing sprint in the race 
  will be of category 2, the second of the most difficult category (&quot;HC&quot;), 
  then one of category 2 again, one of category 1 and finally one of category 
  3. This could require the following data to be entered:</P>

   <P>&nbsp;
   </P>

   
<TABLE BORDER="0" CELLSPACING="0" CELLPADDING="5">

    </TD>
  </TR>
</TABLE>

   <P>&nbsp;
   </P>

   
<P> Note that if you do not use all five available categories, you do not necessarily 
  need to use consecutive categories.</P>

   <P>
      The sum of these points from every 
      <A HREF="Half%20stages.html">
         half stage</A> will be used to calculate a general individual climbing 
      classification from. This classification is independent from the actual 
      stage classification. However, for a competitor to appear in the climbing 
      classification, he/she must successfully complete the 
      <A HREF="Half%20stages.html">
         half stage</A>.</P>

   <P>
      For climbing classifications a separate publication is generated, which 
      lists all the intermediate sprint results as well as the general sprint 
      classification.</P>

   <H2>
      Configuration 
   </H2>

   <P>
      The configuration of climbing points will be done by use of the tab sheet 
      <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Climbing classification</SPAN> of the 
      <A HREF="Half%20stages.html">
         configuration of the particular half stage</A>. This can be found through 
      <SPAN CLASS="help_menu"> Configure selection...</SPAN> in the <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">Configuration</SPAN> 
      menu, when the appropriate 
      <A HREF="Half%20stages.html">
         half stage</A> is selected in the 
      <A HREF="Event%20tree.html">
         event tree</A>.</P>

   <P>&nbsp;
   </P>

   
<P> <IMG src="../screenshots/screen89.gif" width="422" height="411" ALT="Configuration of a climbing classification"></P>

   <P>&nbsp;
   </P>

   <P>
      On the tab sheet there are five lists: <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Cat. 1</SPAN> 
      through <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Cat. 4</SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Order</SPAN>. 
      The sprint points in the category lists correspond to the successive rankings, 
      starting from 1. The numbers in the <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Order</SPAN> 
      list correspond to the categories (1 through 4), laying down the order in 
      which categories are used.</P>

   <H3>
      Add Points 
   </H3>

   <P>
      To add climbing sprint points, the number of points has to be entered in 
      the field above the particular list and <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Add</SPAN> 
      has to be clicked.</P>

   <P>
      There is no real limit to the amount of climbing sprint points entries that 
      you can enter.</P>

   <H3>
      Remove Points 
   </H3>

   <P>
      If a climbing sprint points entry is selected from a list, it can be deleted 
      by clicking <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Remove</SPAN>.</P>

   <H3>
      Add Category Use 
   </H3>

   <P>
      To add the use of a category, the category number has to be entered in the 
      field above the <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Order</SPAN> list and <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Add</SPAN> 
      has to be clicked.</P>

   <P>
      StageRace allows to enter up to 25 category uses, which should be amply 
      sufficient. </P>

   <H3>
      Remove Category Use 
   </H3>

   <P>
      If a category number entry is selected from the <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Order</SPAN> 
      list, it can be deleted by clicking <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Remove</SPAN>.</P>

   <P>
      If the amount of categories used is zero, the <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Climbing 
      classification</SPAN> item will subsequently be removed from the 
      <A HREF="Event%20tree.html">
         event tree</A>.</P>

         Import Competitors from OPTIc File Format 
      </H1>

   <P>
      Competitors from OPTIc can be imported in StageRace so they can be used 
      as an

      Introduction

   <P>
      Alge Timing, with a worldwide network of distributors is a specialist for 
      sports timing with over 30 years of experience in timing consultancy, development 
      and production.</P>

   <P>
      Alge OPTIc is a computerized color photo finish system with integrated processing 
      software. The Color Line Scan Camera scans every movement on the finish 
      line in true color and high resolution.</P>

   <P>
      In cooperation with Alge the StageRace program has been made capable to 
      import files from OPTIc.</P>

   <H2>
      Importing 
   </H2>

   <P>
      Classifications made in OPTIc are available automatically in tab separated 
      text format.</P>

   <P>
      This data can be found in a <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">.txt</SPAN> file of 
      which the name is equal to the one of the race (<SPAN CLASS="screenquote">.rac</SPAN>) 
      that is the subject.</P>

   <P>
      Within StageRace, the 
      <A HREF="Arrival%20tab%20sheet.html">
         <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Arrival</SPAN> tab</A> provides file import. 
      In the <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Import classification</SPAN> file dialog 
      the text file that contains the classification data can be picked. Additionally, 
      the file type in this dialog should be set to <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Alge 
      OPTIc Results</SPAN> so that StageRace bypasses the advanced 
      <A HREF="Control%20import%20classification%20dialog.html">
         <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Control import classification</SPAN> dialog</A> 
      and directly imports the OPTIc data.</P>

   <P>
      For OPTIc operation, please refer to the appropriate documentation.</P>

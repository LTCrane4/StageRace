      with the administration of a road cycling stage race.</P>

   <P>
      Note that user interface issues can typically be found under <EM>Work Space</EM>. 
      However, for configuration issues and <EM>Techniques</EM> exceptions apply 
      and the user interface is described in-place.</P>

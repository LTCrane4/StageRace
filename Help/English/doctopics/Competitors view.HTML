      Competitors View 
   </H3>

   <P>
      If in the 
      
         event tree the <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Competitors</SPAN> item 
      is selected, the competitors view will be visible.</P>

   <P>&nbsp;
   </P>

   
<P> <IMG src="../screenshots/screen42.gif" width="619" height="418" ALT="Competitors view"><P CLASS="caption">Competitors view</P></P>

   
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Spare competitors 
  and normal competitors are indicated with distinct icons.</P>

   <P>
   </P>

   <P>
      While the 
      
      competitors view is visible, all competitors and spare competitors are 
      displayed as a list.</P>

   <H4>
      Adjust the View 
   </H4>

   <P>
      The width of the displayed columns can be adjusted by dragging the little 
      separation line between two column headers.</P>

   <P>
      The various columns can be rearranged by clicking on a column header and 
      dragging it to the desired location.</P>

   
<P> By clicking on a column header, the list will be sorted on that particular 
  column's contents. By clicking the same column header again, the sorting order 
  will be reversed.</P>
<P>Through the <span class="help_menu">View</span> menu coloring of the bars and 
  a grid for the view can be shown, improving the visibility.</P>

   <P>
      View adjustments are stored for the next time you use StageRace.</P>

   <H4>
      Selection 
   </H4>

   <P>
      You can select a competitor by single-clicking on it.</P>

   <P>
      Multiple competitors can be selected in one of the following ways:</P>

   <UL>
      <LI>Click on the first competitor that must be selected, press the Shift 
      key, click the last competitor that must be selected, and release the Shift 
      key; or</LI><LI>Press the Ctrl key, click every competitor that must be 
      selected, and release the Ctrl key.</LI>
   </UL>

   <P>
      Through <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">Select all</SPAN> in the <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">Edit</SPAN> 
      menu you can at once select all competitors.</P>

   <H4>
      Insert 
   </H4>

   <P>
      Through <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">Competitor/Team</SPAN> in the <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">Insert</SPAN> 
      menu a new competitor can be inserted into the competitors view. The 
      
         <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Edit competitor</SPAN> dialog will appear, 
      allowing for the details of this new competitor to be entered.</P>

   <P>
      If <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">Repeatedly</SPAN> in the <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">Insert</SPAN> 
      menu is checked, you will repeatedly be getting the 
      
         <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Edit competitor</SPAN> dialog, in order 
      to speed up the process of entering competitors. If you want to stop, you 
      cancel the current 
      
         <SPAN CLASS="screenquote"> Edit competitor</SPAN> dialog.</P>

   <H4>
      Delete 
   </H4>

   <P>
      Through <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">Delete</SPAN> in the <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">Edit</SPAN> 
      menu one or more selected competitors can be deleted. However, only competitors 
      can be deleted that are not used in an 
      
         arrival.</P>

   <H4>
      Edit 
   </H4>

   <P>
      Through <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">Edit selection...</SPAN> in the <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">Edit</SPAN> 
      menu one selected competitor can be edited. For this the <SPAN CLASS="screenquote"> 
      
      </SPAN> 
      
         <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Edit competitor</SPAN> dialog is displayed.</P>

   
<P>Competitor properties can be edited <em>in-line</em>. Using the mouse pointer, 
  clicking once on a field of a single already selected competitor, the field 
  can be edited. This works for all the fields of a competitor, except the team. 
  That way competitors can be edited more quickly, without going into the <span class="screenquote">Edit 
  competitor</span> dialog. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>

   
<P> <IMG src="../screenshots/screen46.gif" width="345" height="66" ALT="In-line editing of competitor no."><P CLASS="caption">In-line editing of competitor no.</P></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Also the masks can be edited in-line: a pop-up menu will appear when you click 
  on a mask field of a single already selected competitor.</P>

   <H4>
      Clipboard 
   </H4>

   <P>
      
         Cut, copy and paste competitors through the Windows<SUP>&reg;</SUP> clipboard.</P>

   <P>
      Note that if the competitor nos. in the competitors view are grayed out, 
      this is a result of <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">Paste with start nos.</SPAN> 
      in the <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">Edit</SPAN> menu, which is also part of the 
      
         clipboard functionality.</P>

      Swap Competitors 
   </H4>

   <UL>
      
       
   </UL>

   <P>
      When two competitors are selected, they can be swapped trough <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">Swap 
      competitors</SPAN> in the <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">Edit</SPAN> menu. Swapping 
      means that the two competitors exchange start nos. while keeping the rest 
      of their properties (name, team, etcetera).</P>

   <P>
      Swapping can be done between two active competitors, but also between an 
      active competitor and a 
      
         spare competitor.</P>

   <P>
      This is a very handy function when last-minute a competitor needs replacing 
      by a 
      
         spare competitor, or to shuffle competitors within a team during 
      registration of the team (or between teams if you would want to).</P>

   <H4>
      Masking 
   </H4>

   
<P> Automatically assign a number of competitors to one of the  
  masks using the  <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Apply 
  a mask</SPAN> dialog.</P>
<h4>Cleanup Competitors</h4>
<P>Typos in competitor and team details can be corrected with the <span class="screenquote">Cleanup 
  competitors</span> dialog. </P>

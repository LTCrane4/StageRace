    <UL>
      <LI CLASS="li_extensive"><SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Suppress hardware key 
        check on startup</SPAN><BR>
        Normally StageRace would inform you on startup about a missing hardware 
        key, giving you the chance to supply a key before the software falls back 
        into evaluation mode. This can be suppressed through this option.</LI>
      <LI CLASS="li_extensive"><SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Show &quot;Confirm classification 
        file import&quot; dialog to wait for updated classifications</SPAN><BR>
        Through this option you can have StageRace display a  
        dialog as extra step between choosing a file to import from and getting 
        the  import 
        preview dialog. This  
        dialog helps you waiting for the newest version of the file that you 
        want to import.</LI>
      <LI CLASS="li_extensive"><SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Print background colors 
        and images</SPAN><BR>
        This option is copied from the advanced internet options in the Control 
        Panel.</LI>
      <LI CLASS="li_extensive"><SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Indicate missing language 
        strings on publications ('?')</SPAN><BR>
        When StageRace fails to look up certain strings in the  
        multilingual database, through this option an indication for the missing 
        strings can be printed on publications.<BR>
      </LI>
      <LI CLASS="li_extensive"><SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Use Ctrl for switching 
        &quot;Paste with start nos.&quot;</SPAN><BR>
        Normally pressing the Ctrl key on your keyboard while having the  
        competitors view displayed, would toggle <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">Paste 
        with start nos.</SPAN> in the <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">Edit</SPAN> menu. 
        This key-press can be ignored through this option.</LI>
      <LI CLASS="li_extensive"><span class="screenquote">Use Ins/Del keys for arrivals</span><br>
        Enables the use of the keys Ins and Del to work in the arrival 
        tab sheets to respectively insert empty positions or declass. a selection.</LI>
      <LI CLASS="li_extensive"><SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Hide Functions menu for arrival sheets other 
        than stage arrivals</SPAN><BR>
        Hide the Functions menu so that you do not accidentally insert imported 
        data into e.g. sprint or bonus tab sheets as imported data on average 
        goes towards the stage arrival.</LI>
      <LI><span class="screenquote">Protect dialogs against being exited incidentally 
        by hitting Escape</span><br>
        Will simply ignore the Escape key in all dialogs so that you'll have to 
        explicitly activate the <span class="screenquote">OK</span> or <span class="screenquote">Cancel</span> 
        buttons.</LI>

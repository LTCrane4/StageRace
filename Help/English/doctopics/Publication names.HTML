      Publication File Names 
   </H3>

   <P>
      Publications generated by StageRace are given file names that are composed 
      based on the name of the 
      
         event file.</P>

   <P>
      The file names are composed as follows:</P>

   <BLOCKQUOTE> 
   <P CLASS="screenquote">
      [event file name] - [document recognition string].html</P>

   </BLOCKQUOTE>
   <P>
      The <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">event file name</SPAN> is taken from the associated 
      <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">.str</SPAN> file. The document recognition string 
      is specific for each publication, and given in English and French, because 
      these are the official languages of the 
      
         UCI. Documents are of the HTML type.</P>

   <P>
      Some examples:</P>

<H3> Publication File Names </H3>
<P> Publications generated by StageRace are given file names that are composed 
  based on the name of the  event file.</P>
<h4>File Names</h4>
<P> The file names are composed as follows:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE> 
  <P CLASS="screenquote"> [event file name] - [document recognition string].html</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> The <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">event file name</SPAN> is taken from the associated 
  <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">.str</SPAN> file. The document recognition string 
  is specific for each publication, and given in English and French, because these 
  are the official languages of the  UCI. 
  Documents are of the HTML type.</P>
<P> Some examples:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE> 
  <P> <SPAN CLASS="screenquote"> Trofeo Karlsberg - Competitors, Coureurs.html</SPAN></P>
  <P> <SPAN CLASS="screenquote"> Trofeo Karlsberg - Stage 1-1, Etape 1-1.html</SPAN></P>
  <P> <SPAN CLASS="screenquote"> Trofeo Karlsberg - Cross out list 3-2, Liste 
    de barrer 3-2.html</SPAN></P>
  <P> <SPAN CLASS="screenquote"> Trofeo Karlsberg - General 4-1.html </SPAN></P>
  <P> <SPAN CLASS="screenquote"> Trofeo Karlsberg - Table of Contents, Table des 
    mati&egrave;res.html </SPAN> </P>
  <P> Etcetera </P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Illegal characters <span class="screenquote">\ / : * ? &quot; &lt; &gt; |</span> 
  are removed from file names and replaced by underscores.</P>
<P>An exception can be made for the  table 
  of contents, which can be generated as  
  <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">index.html</SPAN>.</P>
<h4>Profiles</h4>
<P>Through the <span class="screenquote">Profile 
  picker</span> dialog you can choose that the publication file names will 
  represent the profile for which they have been generated.</P>
<P>Also you can choose the profile's name to be used, 
  or just an ordinal number that represents the profile.</P>
<P>When you select the <span class="screenquote">Use profile name for file names</span> 
  setting (default):</P>
<blockquote> 
  <p class="screenquote">[event file name] - [profile name] - [document recognition 
    string].html</p>
</blockquote>
<P>When you deselect the <span class="screenquote">Use profile name for file names</span> 
  setting:</P>
<blockquote> 
  <p class="screenquote">[event file name] - profile #[profile number] - [document 
    recognition string].html</p>
</blockquote>
<P>If there is only a single profile for an event, 
  the profile name will not be represented in the 
  publication file names.</P>

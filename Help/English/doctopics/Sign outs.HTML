      Sign Outs 
   </H4>

   <P>
      When a competitor finishes in a half stage, he/she earns the right to start 
      in the next half stage. (Obviously, for the first stage all competitors 
      have the right to start.)</P>

   <P>
         However, a competitor does not necessarily use this right. Sign outs 
         are the competitors that didn't start for the stage, although they could, 
         having the right to do so.</P>

   <P>
      Before you enter the 
      
         ranking for a stage, and preferably also before the actual finish 
      takes place, you should enter the sign outs. Entering sign outs is done 
      through the 
      
         <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Sign outs</SPAN> dialog.</P>

   <P>
      After a competitor is entered, this competitor will not be available anymore 
      to use in a 
      
         arrival.</P>

   <P>
      Riders who drop out during the race should not be introduced as signed out, 
      but will automatically be printed as dropped out on 
      
         bottom of the classification.</P>

   <P>
      Sign outs are usually listed on stage classifications; this depending on 
      
         publication settings.</P>

<H1> Parsing</H1>

   
<P> Through the various settings the way publications 
  look can be very heavily influenced. And for instance for web publishing even 
  a dedicated profile can be established for this. 
  But still a race's web designer may want to do an even deeper integration of 
  publications into its web site.</P>
<P>Someone may want to parse for parts of publications that are of interest. Parsing 
  is the automated process in which the raw publication document files are being 
  scanned for parts that can be recognized as useful for extraction for a certain 
  function. E.g. you may want to automatically extract the top ten-ranked competitors 
  from the general classification, or extract just the table with arrivals, without 
  any header or footer information.</P>
<P>Specifically for this purpose tags are added to the publication document HTML 
  files that can easily be scanned for.</P>
<P>The tages are available as HTML comments, of the following form:</P>
<blockquote> 
  <p class="screenquote">&lt;!-- [tagname]:begin --&gt; ... &lt;!-- [tagname]:end 
    --&gt; </p>
</blockquote>
<P>The comment indicated by <span class="screenquote">[tagname]</span> can be 
  found between the two corresponding <em>begin</em> and <em>end</em> tags.</P>
<P>The following tag names can exist in StageRace documents:</P>
<table border="0">
  <tr> 
    <th> 
      <p>Tag name</p>

    <th>

      Table of Contents 
   </H3>

   <P>
      You can generate a table of contents through <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">Table 
      of contents</SPAN> in the <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">Generate</SPAN> menu.</P>

   <P>
      The table of contents includes references (hyperlinks) to all the publications 
      that are part of the event (except for 
      
         sign in lists).</P>

   
<P> However, if you use  communiqu&eacute; 
  numbering, only the publications that are yet  
  published are included in the table of contents.</P>
<P>Tables of contents can be printed in normal or reverse order. In reverse order 
  you always have the most recent items at the top. Also the placing within the 
  table of contents of the competitors and teams lists references can be chosen.</P>

   <H4>
      
      Index File 
   </H4>

   
<P> The table of contents can be generated with a file name that differs from 
  the  naming convention that is used for 
  all other publications. It can be <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">index.html</SPAN>. 
  This way, when uploading your event's publications to a dedicated directory 
  on your web server, the event will be easily accessible over the internet by 
  only using this directory's name (depending on server configuration). You can 
  set this in the  HTML settings. When using 
  profiles, this setting can be done on a per-profile 
  basis.</P>

   <P>
      When <span class="screenquote"> index.html</span> is used
      
       it is not longer possible for StageRace to determine whether a supposed 
      table of contents file actually applies to the particular event. There is 
      a risk that it uses a wrong <span class="screenquote">index.html</span> 
      for e.g. 
      
         printing, 
      
         uploading or displaying in the 
      
         event tree. You can prevent this by examining (and possibly 
      
         regenerating) the table of contents. Also you are quite sure when 
      you keep your event and its publications in a separate folder locally.</P>

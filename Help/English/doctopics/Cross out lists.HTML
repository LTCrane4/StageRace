      Cross Out Lists 
   </H3>

   <P>
      Often cross out lists are experienced by members of the jury as a pleasant 
      tool, to be used during the race. They use it to keep track of which competitors 
      drop out and how the caravan is composed.</P>

   <P>
      Cross out lists can be generated through <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">Cross out 
      lists</SPAN> in the <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">Generate</SPAN> menu. The cross 
      out lists for all stages will be generated instantly then. Note that no 
      cross out lists are generated for time trials.</P>

   <P>
      All 
      
         competitors that are competing in the event are stated on the cross 
      out list. For the competitors not starting in a 
      
         half stage (not finished in the previous 
      
         half stage(s) or 
      
         signed out for this half stage), the frame is colored black.</P>

   <P>
      By default every row in the cross out list contains ten competitors. However, 
      if <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Print team names</SPAN> in the 
      
         publication settings is selected, you can also set the number of 
      <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">competitors per team</SPAN> for which then the 
      team names are printed next to each row.</P>

   <P>
      It is your task to match the number of competitors in each row to the number 
      of competitors in each team. StageRace does not guarantee that the competitors 
      that are printed in one row belong to the same team; this is your responsibility, 
      either through 
      
         entering competitors or through the 
      
         publication settings.</P>

   <P>
      Team names that are printed on cross out lists are abbreviated to prevent 
      them from taking up too much space of the document.</P>

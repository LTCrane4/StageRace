      Full Stages 
   </H3>

   <P>
      An event is divided into full stages, also referred to as days, because 
      every full stage will in practice correspond to a day of your event.</P>

   <P>
      A full stage holds a number of 
      
         half stages and possibly a 
      
         communiqu&eacute;.</P>

   <H4>
      Adding 
   </H4>

   <P>
      A new stage can be added through <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">Full stage...</SPAN> 
      in <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">Insert</SPAN> in the <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">Configure</SPAN> 
      menu. The <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Stage settings</SPAN> dialog (read below) 
      will appear.</P>

   <P>
      New stages are added at the bottom of the 
      
         event tree.</P>

   <P>&nbsp;
   </P>

   <P>
      It is not possible to insert new stages between existing stages.</P>

   <P>
      After adding one or more stages, the following step should be to 
      
         add half stages into the particular stage or day.</P>

   <H4>
      Deleting 
   </H4>

   <P>
      A stage that is selected in the 
      
         event tree can be deleted through <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">Delete...</SPAN> 
      in the <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">Configure</SPAN> menu. A confirmation will 
      be asked for after which the entire stage will be deleted, including all 
      the underlying 
      
         half stages and the possible 
      
         communiqu&eacute;.</P>

   <H4>
      Stage Settings 
   </H4>

   <P>
      In the <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Stage settings</SPAN> dialog, the date 
      of the particular full stage or day will be asked for. Enter an informative 
      text. Most often the name of a holiday is preferred above the actual date.</P>

      The <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Stage settings</SPAN> dialog for an existing 
      stage can be accessed through <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">Configure selection...</SPAN> 
      in the <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">Configure</SPAN> menu, when the stage is 
      selected in the 
      
         event tree.</P>

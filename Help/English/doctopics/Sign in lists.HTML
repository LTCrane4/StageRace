   <P>
      A sign in list can be used prior to the start of a half stage, to have competitors 
      write their signature on.</P>

   <P>
      Sign in lists can be generated through <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">Sign in lists</SPAN> 
      in the <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">Generate</SPAN> menu. The sign in lists for 
      all stages will be generated instantly then.</P>

   <P>
      Only 
      
         competitors that finished the previous half stage are stated on the 
      sign in list.</P>

   <P>
      After the process of signing in, the not signed in competitors can be processed 
      as signed out, after which the final 
      
         cross out lists can be 
      
         generated.</P>

   <P>
      Sign in lists are not listed in the event's 
      
         table of contents.</P>

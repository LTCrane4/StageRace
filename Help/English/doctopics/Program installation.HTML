      Program Installation

   <P>
      The StageRace installation comes as one single executable file (<SPAN CLASS="screenquote">stagerace2003xxx.exe</SPAN>).</P>

   <P>
      The installation file will unpack itself and start the actual installation 
      wizard. Step through this installation wizard using the <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Next</SPAN> 
      button.</P>

   <P>
      Ultimately the installation program performs the following tasks:</P>

   <P>

   <UL>
         <LI CLASS="li_extensive"><EM>Copying files</EM><BR> Program, help and 
         tools files will be copied into a folder that can be chosen during the 
         installation program.</LI><LI CLASS="li_extensive"><EM>Hardware key device

         enables registered users to use their

      Shortcut icons are added to the Windows<sup>&reg;</sup> Start menu.<EM></EM></LI>
   </UL>

   <P>
      When you install StageRace on Windows<sup>&reg;</sup> XP, the file <span class="screenquote">StageRace.exe.manifest</span> 
      will arrange for StageRace to make use of the theme that is selected in 
      your Windows<sup>&reg;</sup>. This file is by standard part of the installation.</P>

   <P>
         By use of <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Add or remove components</SPAN> in 
         the Software part of the Control Panel, StageRace can be removed from 
         the computer system entirely, except for hardware key device drivers.</P>

      <EM>Without agreeing to our 
      
         License agreement it is not allowed and thus not possible to install 
      our software.</EM></P>

      Generate 
   </H2>

   <P>
      While <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">Automatically</SPAN> in the <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">Generate</SPAN> 
      menu is checked (switched on), StageRace automatically generates all publications 
      for you, whenever you enter any data during the event. (Note that changes 
      to the 
      
         configuration do not trigger the immediate regeneration of publications.)</P>

   <P>
      You can however, through the Generate menu, choose to generate or regenerate 
      the desired publications.</P>

   <P>
      The following functions are available for generating a specific type of 
      document for the entire event:</P>

   <UL>
      <LI><SPAN CLASS="help_menu"> 
      
         Table of contents</SPAN>&nbsp;</LI><LI><SPAN CLASS="help_menu"> Communiqu&eacute;s</SPAN>&nbsp;</LI><LI><SPAN CLASS="help_menu"> 
      Competitors lists</SPAN>&nbsp;</LI><LI><SPAN CLASS="help_menu"> 
      
         Cross out lists</SPAN>&nbsp;</LI><LI><SPAN CLASS="help_menu"> 
      
         Sign in lists</SPAN>&nbsp;</LI>
   </UL>

   <P>
      The following functions are also available:</P>

   <UL>
      <LI CLASS=" li_extensive"><SPAN CLASS="help_menu">Selection</SPAN><BR> Generates 
      the document that is associated with the currently selected 
      
         event tree item</LI><LI CLASS=" li_extensive"><SPAN CLASS="help_menu">All 
      stages and dependencies</SPAN><BR> Generates all the half stages publications 
      and underlying publications for the entire event</LI><LI CLASS=" li_extensive"><SPAN CLASS="help_menu">All</SPAN><BR>

   </UL>

   <H3>
      Old Publications 
   </H3>

   <P>
      Note that StageRace only generates publications for which content exists. 
      So if ever e.g. a half stage classification or a communiqu&eacute; is generated 
      as publication, the resulting files will remain to exist. Even when you 
      empty the arrival (so that no new publication for this is generated anymore) 
      or delete the communiqu&eacute;, the file will stay until you remove it 
      manually. This means that StageRace might also display such old publications 
      in the 
      
         publication view at some moment.</P>

   <P>
      You may want to print 
      
         time stamps on publications in order to see how old a publication 
      is. </P>

   <H3>
      
      Read-only 
   </H3>

   <P>
      Through <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">Read-only publication</SPAN> in the <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">Generate</SPAN> 
      menu, you can determine whether or not a publication can be overwritten 
      by StageRace.</P>

   <P>
      When StageRace encounters an existing publication that it cannot regenerate 
      due to the read-only flag, an error message will be displayed.</P>

   <H3>
      Edit Publication Externally 
   </H3>

   <P>
      StageRace allows to edit publications in an 
      
         external editor of your choice.</P>

      Generate 
   </H2>

   
<P> While <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">Automatically</SPAN> in the <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">Generate</SPAN> 
  menu is checked (switched on), StageRace automatically generates all publications 
  for you, whenever you enter any data during the event. (Note that changes to 
  the  configuration do not trigger 
  the immediate regeneration of publications.) You can however, through the Generate 
  menu, choose to generate or regenerate the desired publications.</P>
<h3>Background Generating</h3>
<P>Publications are always generated in the <em>background</em>. This means that 
  you can continue what you were doing in the foreground. This is convenient anyhow, 
  but also important, if you use StageRace in a distributed environment with the 
  StageRace Server. In this situation it is not necessarely 
  always you yourself who triggers the publication generation.</P>
<P>The progress of background publications generation is shown in a progress bar 
  in the status bar. StageRace is able to restart 
  the generation process when you (or an incoming request of the StageRace 
  Server) re-requests the same generation process before it was finished.</P>
<P>If publications are regenerated in the background while visible in the publication 
  view, the view will be refreshed and its scroll position will conveniently 
  be restored. This also applies to monitoring.</P>

   <h3>Generate Menu Functions</h3>

   <P>
      The following functions are available for generating a specific type of 
      document for the entire event:</P>

   <UL>
      <LI><SPAN CLASS="help_menu"> 
      
         Table of contents</SPAN>&nbsp;</LI><LI><SPAN CLASS="help_menu"> Communiqu&eacute;s</SPAN>&nbsp;</LI><LI><SPAN CLASS="help_menu"> 
      Competitors lists</SPAN>&nbsp;</LI><LI><SPAN CLASS="help_menu"> 
      
         Cross out lists</SPAN>&nbsp;</LI><LI><SPAN CLASS="help_menu"> 
      
         Sign in lists</SPAN>&nbsp;</LI>
   </UL>

   <P>
      The following functions are also available:</P>

   <UL>
      <LI CLASS=" li_extensive"><SPAN CLASS="help_menu">Selection</SPAN><BR> Generates 
      the document that is associated with the currently selected 
      
         event tree item</LI><LI CLASS=" li_extensive"><SPAN CLASS="help_menu">All 
      stages and dependencies</SPAN><BR> Generates all the half stages publications 
      and underlying publications for the entire event</LI><LI CLASS=" li_extensive"><SPAN CLASS="help_menu">All</SPAN><BR> 
      Generates all the publications for the entire event </LI>
   </UL>

   <H3>
      Old Publications 
   </H3>

   
<P> Note that StageRace only generates publications for which content exists. 
  So if ever e.g. a half stage classification or a communiqu&eacute; is generated 
  as publication, the resulting files will remain to exist. Even when you empty 
  the arrival (so that no new publication for this is generated anymore) or delete 
  the communiqu&eacute;, the file will stay until you remove it manually. This 
  means that StageRace might also display such old publications in the  
  publication view at some moment. However, you can also select in the HTML 
  settings that dummy documents must be generated for when no data are (yet) 
  available for particular publications.</P>

   <P>
      You may want to print 
      
         time stamps on publications in order to see how old a publication 
      is. </P>

   <H3>
      
      Read-only 
   </H3>

   <P>
      Through <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">Read-only publication</SPAN> in the <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">Generate</SPAN> 
      menu, you can determine whether or not a publication can be overwritten 
      by StageRace.</P>

   <P>
      When StageRace encounters an existing publication that it cannot regenerate 
      due to the read-only flag, an error message will be displayed.</P>

   <H3>
      Edit Publication Externally 
   </H3>

   <P>
      StageRace allows to edit publications in an 
      
         external editor of your choice.</P>

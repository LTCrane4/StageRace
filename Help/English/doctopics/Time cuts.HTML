<H1> Time Cuts</H1>

   
<P> Competitors that arrive at a time distance from the winner of a half stage 
  that is larger than a certain percentage of the winner's time (the <em>finish 
  deadline</em>) are typically taken out of the race (<em>time cuts</em>). This 
  can be administrated by StageRace.</P>
<P>Time cuts functionality is found at the following places in StageRace:</P>
<ul>
  <li class="li_extensive"><em>Half stage configuration</em><br>
    In the half stage settings the finish deadline for that half stage can be 
    given in a percentage number. A value of 0% signifies no time cuts to apply 
    to this half stage.</li>
  <li class="li_extensive"><em>Half stage 
    arrival</em><br>
    In the arrival tab sheet competitors 
    arriving after the finish deadline are indicated in red highlighting. The 
    finish deadline can again be adjusted here, because juries often change the 
    finish deadline on basis of what actually took place during a half stage.</li>
  <li class="li_extensive"><em>Publications</em><br>
    Time cuts are shown on publications, either in the statistics report in the 
    footer, or in a seperate part of the 
    arrivals listing. This can be configured through the publication 
    settings. Depending on ranking settings 
    the time cuts are excluded from derived 
    classifications.</li>
</ul>

<H1> Profiles</H1>

   
<p> A <em>profile</em> is a combined set of publication 
  settings, HTML settings and upload 
  settings that are tailored for a specific purpose or audience.</p>
<p>Typical profiles would be &quot;web&quot;, &quot;jury&quot;, &quot;press&quot;, 
  but you can configure this any way you like. Imagine here that the jury wants 
  different columns of information included 
  than the press, and that the layout (e.g. colors) for web publishing is very 
  different from printed publications.</p>
<p>As many additional profiles can be added as you desire.</p>
<p>You can set the current profile in the <span class="screenquote">Profile 
  picker</span> dialog that you can find through <span class="help_menu">Profile 
  picker...</span> in the <span class="help_menu">Configure</span> menu. Setting 
  a profile affects:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The settings dialog, which will show the publication 
    settings, HTML settings and upload 
    settings specific for the currently set profile;</li>
  <li>The publication view, that will exclusively 
    show publications for the currently set profile; and</li>
  <li>The generating of publications, because only 
    publications are being generated for the currently 
    set profile. This means that you'll have to switch profiles and generate 
    publications subsequently.</li>
</ul>
<p>A shortcut to setting the current profile is the <span class="screenquote">Profile 
  picker</span> dialog drop-down box in the standard 
  toolbar.</p>
<p>All profiles share the same general settings, 
  ranking settings and access 
  settings.</p>
<p>The publication file names will represent 
  the profile name for which they have been generated. 
  However, if there is only a single profile for an event, the profile name will 
  not be represented in the publication file 
  names.</p>

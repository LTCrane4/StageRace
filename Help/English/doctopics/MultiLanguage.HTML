      MultiLanguage 
   </H3>

   <P>
      Under the name <EM>MultiLanguage</EM> StageRace provides a system to influence 
      the languages in which 
      
         publications are generated. 

   <H4>
      Choose Languages 
   </H4>

   <P>
      In the <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Required languages</SPAN> section of the 
      
         publication settings dialog you can select the languages that you 
      want to use on your publications.</P>

   <P>
      Left you can enter the name of a language that you require. It will be appended 
      to the list of required languages when you click the <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Add</SPAN> 
      button.</P>

   <P>
      Languages can be removed from the list of required languages by selecting 
      them and clicking the <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Remove</SPAN> button; one 
      by one. </P>

   <P>
      Note that StageRace will allow you to enter languages that do not actually 
      exist yet in the database on your computer.</P>

   <H4>
      Manage Languages 
   </H4>

   
<P> Every language plus its associated  
  text strings is stored in a Microsoft<SUP>&reg;</SUP> database file, named 
  <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">MultiLanguage2005.mdb</SPAN>. The file resides in 
  the same folder as <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">StageRace.exe</SPAN>.</P>

   <P>
      This database can be modified using Microsoft<SUP>&reg;</SUP> Access.</P>

   <P>
      The database has two components:</P>

   <UL>
      <LI>A table <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Translations</SPAN>; and</LI><LI>A 
      query <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Add new language</SPAN>.</LI>
   </UL>

   <H5>
      Translations 
   </H5>

   <P>
      The table <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Translations</SPAN> consists of text 
      in all available languages. For every text (record) there are:</P>

   <UL>
      <LI>The <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Language</SPAN> for which it is intended;</LI><LI>The 
      <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Identifier</SPAN> that is unique within this language; 
      and</LI><LI>The <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Value</SPAN> that is the actual 
      text as it is printed.</LI>
   </UL>

   <p>&nbsp;
   </p>

   <p>
      <IMG src="../screenshots/screen79.gif" width="344" height="329" ALT="Translations table in Access"><P CLASS="caption">Translations table in Access</P></p>

   <p>&nbsp;
   </p>

   
<P> The <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Identifier</SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Language</SPAN> 
  fields have to be entirely correct. For instance, these fields are case-sensitive.</P>
<P>Values of translations can be any Unicode characters.</P>

   <H5>
      Add new Language 
   </H5>

   <P>
      The query <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Add new language</SPAN> allows to add 
      an entire new language at once. On executing the query you will be asked 
      for a <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">New language code</SPAN>. As a result of 
      the query all 
      
         existing texts in the database are copied for the new language (code).</P>

   <P>&nbsp;
   </P>

   <P>
      <IMG src="../screenshots/screen81.gif" width="251" height="119" ALT="Add new language query in Access"><P CLASS="caption">Add new language query in Access</P></P>

   <P>&nbsp;
   </P>

   <P>
      Naturally, these 
      
         texts remain to be translated in the <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Translations</SPAN> 
      table.</P>

   
<P> Note that by convention the names of the available languages are based on 
  the name of a language in the language itself. This results in language codes 
  <span class="screenquote">ES</span>, <span class="screenquote">DE</span> and 
  <span class="screenquote">NL</span> (rather than <span class="screenquote">SP</span>, 
  <span class="screenquote">GE</span> and <span class="screenquote">DU</span>). 
  Language codes can only exist of characters ranging A-Z and 0-9.</P>

   <H4>
      Available Languages 
   </H4>

   
<P> The following languages are standardly available in StageRace, given in alphabetical 
  order: </P>

   <UL>
  <LI>Dutch (<span class="screenquote">NL</span>),</LI>
  <LI>English (<SPAN CLASS="screenquote">EN</SPAN>),</LI>
  <LI>French (<SPAN CLASS="screenquote">FR</SPAN>),</LI>
  <li>German (<span class="screenquote">DE</span>),</li>
  <li>Portugese (<span class="screenquote">PT</span>), and</li>
  <LI>Spanish (<span class="screenquote">ES</span>)..</LI>
</UL>

   <P>
      Feel free to submit to us any new languages that you add, so we can make 
      them available to other users.</P>

   <h4>
      Evaluate Strings
   </h4>

   <P>
      You can 
      
         choose missing strings to be replaced by a question mark in publications. 
      That way you can easily discover which strings you still need to add to 
      a language.</P>

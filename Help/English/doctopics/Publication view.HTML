      Publication View 
   </H3>

   
<P> If in the  event tree an item is selected 
  that has a publication associated with it, the publication view will be visible, 
  displaying this publication. However, if the publication is not actually generated 
  yet, a blank view is displayed rather than the publication view. The exact publication 
  that is shown also depends on the currently set profile.</P>

   <P>
      
         Publications are in the form of separate HTML files, which is the 
      leading internet document file type. Therefore the publication view is in 
      fact an internet browser.</P>

   <P>
      While the publication view is visible, the following functions are available:</P>

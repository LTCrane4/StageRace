      Prologue 
   </H2>

   <P>
      In the 
      
         general settings you can set an event to start with a prologue 
      
         <span class="help_uci">(2.6.005 and 2.6.022)</span>. 

   <P>
      If your event is set to start with a prologue: 

   <UL>
      <LI CLASS="li_extensive">The 
      
         stage numbering is as follows: P, 1, 2, etcetera;</LI><LI CLASS="li_extensive">The 
      
         half stage numbering within the P stage is as follows: P, 2, 3, etcetera; 
      and</LI><LI CLASS="li_extensive">The prologue (half stage) will not count 
      towards the total distance that can be printed on general classifications.</LI>
   </UL>

   <p>
      Indication of prologues is abbreviated to the letter P.</p>

   <p>&nbsp;

      <IMG src="../screenshots/screen74.gif" width="285" height="144" ALT="Prologue in the event tree"><P CLASS="caption">Prologue in the event tree</P></p>

   <p>&nbsp;
   </p>

   <P>
      Note that as a result the distance on the general classification after the 
      prologue will show zero, if distance is selected for printing.</P>

   <P>
      Also note that it is very unlikely to have a half stage 2 or on when a prologue 
      is ridden in a full stage.</P>

      <P>
         However a prologue is typically a time trial, you are not forced to configure 
         this as such. In other words: you event could start with a normal half 
         stage even when the event is set to start with a prologue. 

      <P>
         Note that 
         
            Scan'O'Vision and 
         
            FinishLynx output will have stage numbering as if no prologue 
         was selected.

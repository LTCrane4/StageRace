   <P>
      The following are the things you can do to enter all the information that 
      originates during an event.</P>

   <P>
      First 
      
         competitors (and in consequence 
      
         teams) have to be entered.</P>

   <P>
      
         Sign in lists allow competitors to sign in, before the actual start 
      of the race. 
      
         Cross out lists are then made to be given to officials for during 
      the race.</P>

   
<P> Then arrivals have to be entered, both for the actual  
  stage arrival as for all intermediate sprints that have been configured, 
  after which classifications will be generated. Also taken into account for the 
  classifications are the individual  penalties and 
  bonuses (corrections) and the  signed out competitors 
  that you can enter for every half stage. Also time 
  cuts are automatically applied.</P>

   <P>The main event as well as every part of it can have a  
  communiqué for any additional information that jury or organizer wants to 
  provide.</P>

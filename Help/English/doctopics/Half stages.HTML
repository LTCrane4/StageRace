      Half Stages 
   </H3>

   <P>
      An event is divided into 
      
         full stages or days. Next, every such 
      
         stage consists of one or more half stages.</P>

   <P>
      A half stage is the only thing in StageRace that actually requires competitors 
      to do any work; it represents them riding from A to B (or from A to A, for 
      that matter).</P>

   <P>
      A half stage can optionally be a 
      
         time trial.</P>

   <P>
      A half stages holds at a maximum the following items:</P>

   <UL>
      <LI>Stage arrival, with 
      
         bonuses and 
      
         corrections;</LI><LI>General classification;</LI><LI>General classifications

   <P>
      When a 
      
         full stage is selected in the 
      
         event tree, a new half stage can be added through <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">Half

      menu. The <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Half stage settings</SPAN> dialog (read 
      below) will appear.</P>

   <P>
      New half stages are added at the end of the list of existing half stages 
      for the particular full stage.</P>

   <P>
      A half stage that is selected in the 
      
         event tree can be deleted through <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">Delete...</SPAN> 
      in the <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">Configure</SPAN> menu. A confirmation will 
      be asked for after which the entire half stage will be deleted.</P>

      Main Settings 
   </H5>

   <P>
      The following parameters can be entered:</P>

   <UL>
      <LI CLASS="li_extensive"><SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Title</SPAN><BR> Enter 
      the title of the half stage. <BR> Often the start and finish locations of 
      the particular half stage are entered, e.g. &quot;Maastricht-Maastricht&quot; 
      or &quot;Paris-Roubaix&quot;.</LI><LI CLASS="li_extensive"><SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Opening 
      hour</SPAN><BR> Enter the starting time of the half stage.<BR> Note that 
      this is an informational field and is not used in any calculations.</LI><LI CLASS="li_extensive"><SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Distance: 
      ... rounds of ... meters</SPAN><BR> Enter the number of rounds and the distance 
      per round.<BR> The number of rounds should always be one or more. Therefore, 
      with city-to-city events the number of rounds is normally one exactly and 
      the total distance will be entered directly as it is.<BR> For time trials 
      the number of rounds is forced to one.<br> What you enter is always interpreted 
      as a <em>meters</em> value. Even if you choose to print only <em>miles</em> 
      values on 
      
         publications, you still have to enter values in meters here.</LI><LI CLASS="li_extensive"><SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Time 
      trial</SPAN><BR> Set the half stage to be a 
      
         time trial. Additionally choose the type of 
      
         time trial: 
      <UL>
         <LI CLASS="screenquote">Input net times</LI><LI CLASS="screenquote">Input 
         gross times</LI>
      </UL>

      </LI><LI CLASS="li_extensive"><SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Exclude from general</SPAN><BR> 
      Set the half stage arrival not to be added to the general classification 
      and the cumulative distance. This is useful for 
      
         team time trials. Note that bonus seconds etc. are nevertheless counted 
      as before.</LI><LI><SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Only count deciding competitor 
      towards teams classification</SPAN><BR> Set the teams classification only 
      to use the competitor that in the 
      
         <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Ranking</SPAN> section of the settings dialog 
      is set as the deciding competitor. This is useful for 
      
         team time trials that should have every team only count once towards 
      the teams classification.</LI>
   </UL>

   <H5>
      Points and Bonus Schemes 
   </H5>

   <P>
      For every single half stage you can configure the desired scheme for 
      
         bonus seconds that counts towards the general classification and 
      the desired points schemes for 
      
         sprint, 
      
         points and 
      
         climbing classifications. For each of these four points and bonus 
      schemes there exists an extra tab sheet in the <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Half 
      stage settings</SPAN> dialog.</P>

      Half Stages 
   </H3>

   <P>
      An event is divided into 
      
         full stages or days. Next, every such 
      
         stage consists of one or more half stages.</P>

   <P>
      A half stage is the only thing in StageRace that actually requires competitors 
      to do any work; it represents them riding from A to B (or from A to A, for 
      that matter).</P>

   <P>
      A half stage can optionally be a 
      
         time trial.</P>

   
<P> A half stage holds at a maximum the following items:</P>

   
<UL>
  <LI>Stage arrival, with  bonuses and  
    corrections, and for time trials on gross 
    times sorted an arrival list;</LI>
  <LI>General classification, optionally also sorted on start no.;</LI>
  <LI>Masks: 
    <ul>
      <li>Stage classifications; and</li>
      <li>General classifications;</li>
    </ul>
  </LI>
  <LI>Teams classification;</LI>
  <LI>  Sprint classification;</LI>
  <LI>  Points classification;</LI>
  <LI>  Climbing classification;</LI>
  <LI>Most aggressive 
    rider classification;</LI>
  <li>Time trial starting order;</li>
  <LI>  Cross out list;</LI>
  <LI>Sign in list;</LI>
  <LI>Sign outs; and</LI>
  <LI>   Communiqu&eacute;.</LI>
</UL>
<p>Note that often you will just have one single half stage per full 
  stage or day. For this reason half stage numbering is by default suppressed, 
  except of course for when there actually are more than one single half stage 
  in a stage. Numbering will be 1, 2, 3-1, 3-2, 
  4, rather than 1-1, 2-1, 3-1, 3-2, 4-1. This can be changed by general 
  settings.</p>

   <P>
      When a 
      
         full stage is selected in the 
      
         event tree, a new half stage can be added through <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">Half 
      stage...</SPAN> in <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">Insert</SPAN> in the <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">Configure</SPAN> 
      menu. The <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Half stage settings</SPAN> dialog (read 
      below) will appear.</P>

   <P>
      New half stages are added at the end of the list of existing half stages 
      for the particular full stage.</P>

   <P>
      It is not possible to insert new half stages between existing half stages 
      in the same full stage.</P>

   <H4>
      Deleting 
   </H4>

   <P>
      A half stage that is selected in the 
      
         event tree can be deleted through <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">Delete...</SPAN> 
      in the <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">Configure</SPAN> menu. A confirmation will 
      be asked for after which the entire half stage will be deleted.</P>

      Half Stage Settings 
   </H4>

   <P>
      The <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Half stage settings</SPAN> dialog for an existing 
      stage can be accessed through <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">Configure selection...</SPAN> 
      in the <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">Configure</SPAN> menu, when the half stage 
      is selected in the 
      
         event tree.</P>

   <H5>
      Main Settings 
   </H5>

   <P>
      The following parameters can be entered:</P>

   
<UL>
  <LI CLASS="li_extensive"><SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Title</SPAN><BR>
    Enter the title of the half stage. <BR>
    Often the start and finish locations of the particular half stage are entered, 
    e.g. &quot;Maastricht-Maastricht&quot; or &quot;Paris-Roubaix&quot;.</LI>
  <LI CLASS="li_extensive"><SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Opening hour</SPAN><BR>
    Enter the starting time of the half stage.<BR>
    Note that this is an informational field and is not used in any calculations.</LI>
  <LI CLASS="li_extensive"><SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Distance: ... rounds of ... 
    meters</SPAN><BR>
    Enter the number of rounds and the distance per round.<BR>
    The number of rounds should always be one or more. Therefore, with city-to-city 
    events the number of rounds is normally one exactly and the total distance 
    will be entered directly as it is.<BR>
    For time trials the number of rounds is forced to one.<br>
    What you enter is always interpreted as a <em>meters</em> value. Even if you 
    choose to print only <em>miles</em> values on  
    publications, you still have to enter values in meters here.</LI>
  <LI><span class="screenquote">Finish deadline</span><br>
    The finish deadline for the half stage can 
    be given in a percentage number. A value of 0% signifies no time 
    cuts to apply to this half stage.</LI>
  <LI CLASS="li_extensive"><SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Time trial</SPAN><BR>
    Set the half stage to be a  time trial. Additionally 
    choose the type of  time trial: 
    <UL>
      <LI CLASS="screenquote">Input net times</LI>
      <LI CLASS="screenquote">Input gross times</LI>
    </UL>
  </LI>
  <LI><span class="screenquote">Allow late start time changes</span><br>
    Choose if it is allowed for this time trial 
    to make changes to the starting 
    order even when already competitors have been ranked. </LI>
  <LI><SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Exclude from general</SPAN><BR>
    Set the half stage arrival not to be added to the general classification and 
    the cumulative distance. This is useful for  
    team time trials. Note that bonus seconds etc. are nevertheless counted 
    as before.</LI>
  <LI><SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Only count deciding competitor towards teams classification</SPAN><BR>
    Set the teams classification only to use the competitor that in the  
    <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Ranking</SPAN> section of the settings dialog 
    is set as the deciding competitor. This is useful for  
    team time trials that should have every team only count once towards the 
    teams classification.</LI>
</UL>

   <H5>
      Points and Bonus Schemes 
   </H5>

   
<P> For every single half stage you can configure the desired scheme for  
  bonus seconds that counts towards the general classification and the desired 
  points schemes for  sprint,  
  points and  climbing classifications. 
  For each of these four points and bonus schemes there exists an extra tab sheet 
  in the <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Half stage settings</SPAN> dialog.</P>
<h4>Configure All</h4>
<P>Rather than configuring all half stage settings and schemes for one single 
  half stage, you can choose <span class="help_menu">Configure all</span> in the 
  <span class="help_menu">Configure</span> menu so that you can configure a single 
  type of configuration data for all half stages at once, e.g. all half stage 
  settings, or all bonus schemes, et cetera.</P>

   <P>
      With protection it is not longer possible to alter the main characteristics 
      of an event. This can be desirable to enforce a good 
      
         division of tasks between 
      
         configuration and 
      
         administration of an event, as described elsewhere.</P>

   <P>
   </P>

   
<P> The following access settings can be made.</P>

   <P>
   </P>

   <P>
   </P>

   
<P> You can set the configuration access to:</P>

   
<UL>
  <LI> Free;</LI>
  <LI>Only for users that have the correct password. Enter the password when access 
    through password is selected; or</LI>
  <LI>Only when the hardware key is connected that is connected at this time.</LI>
</UL>

   <P>

   
<P>Note that the protection of the document is only a protection of the configuration 
  settings. Data input and processing will remain possible as normal.</P>

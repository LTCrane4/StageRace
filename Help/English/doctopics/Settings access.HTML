      With protection it is not longer possible to alter the main characteristics 
      of an event. This can be desirable to enforce a good 
      
         division of tasks between 
      
         configuration and 
      
         administration of an event, as described elsewhere.</P>

   <P>
   </P>

   <P>
      The following access settings can be made:</P>

   <P>
   </P>

   <P>
   </P>

   <P>
      Set the configuration access to:</P>

   <UL>
      <LI> Free;</LI><LI>Only for users that have the correct password; or</LI><LI>Only 
      when the hardware key is connected that is connected at this time.</LI>
   </UL>

   <P>

   <P>
      Enter:</P>

   <UL>
      <LI> The password when access through password is selected</LI>
   </UL>

   <P>
      Note that the protection of the document is only a protection of the configuration 
      settings. Data input and processing will remain possible as normal.</P>

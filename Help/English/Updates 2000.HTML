V1.05 bèta - 2000.1.05 bèta</P></TD><TD> <H3> Release note </H3><P> After a week 
of real life use of StageRace in order to make mirror classifications on site 
at the 'Ronde van Nederland' ('Tour de Hollande'), only a few small changes were 
indicated, as enumerated below. These leaded to the release in question. Look 
for a more thourough report on our 'Ronde van Nederland' experiences on our web 
site.</P><H3> Bugs fixed </H3><OL><LI VALUE="29">Sprints classification generator 
has been adjusted after calculation errors and in order to remove competitors 
from the general sprints classification, which dropped out of the race </LI><LI>Problem 
solved where tree view icons for sprint or climbing classification were not visible 
after inserting new half stage, but only first when document reloaded or half 
stage settings altered </LI><LI>Changing the current presentation between stage, 
general or masks did also enforce a redraw even when not a half stage was displayed. 
This is sorted out now </LI></OL><H3> New functionality added </H3><OL><LI VALUE="32">Function 
added to the arrival dialog to cut off all times on full seconds. Documented in 
help </LI><LI>In the arrival dialog (functions button) there is a function available 
now to remove gaps in the ranking for the current classification. Documented in 
help </LI><LI>Through Settings, an accuracy for portions of seconds can be set. 
The thousandth edit box in the (time trial) arrival dialog now adjusts to this 
setting, because it was decided on in practice that this would largely improve 
the comfort of use of the particular dialogs. Documented in help </LI><LI>To improve 
the overview, stage and half stage numbering is included in the tree view of the 
StageRace documents </LI><LI>Title ('date') of full stage can be changed when 
a stage already exists. This was not possible yet </LI><LI>An extra message box 
at startup of the program is added to alert the user of the absence of a hardware 
key </LI><LI>Commencement time stated on stage classifications </LI></OL><H3> 
Optimised </H3><OL><LI VALUE="39">Length of masked classification titles and file 
names increased from 15 to 25 </LI><LI>In addition to [fix 29], all classification 
generators (general, climbing, sprint and team) are derived from the same basic 
module now, instead of from different independent modules. This should be an improvement 
to the reliability of classification generation, as well as to future maintenance 
of these modules. These changes should not be experienced by the user </LI><LI>More 
classifications have international document titles now, instead of English only

software, separator delimited text file import is implemented in the existing 
file import routines in the arrival dialogs. Documented in help </LI><LI>Through 
Options in the Extra menu, a dialog can be enabled, appearing between selection 
of an import file and the import file preview dialog which allows to see some 
time information in order to wait for an updated version before actually importing 
it. This being helpful in the real time environment. Documented in help </LI><LI>Allowing 
file export to the Alge OPTIc finish camera and AMB it ChronX identification software, 
new menu entries have been made available in the Tools menu. For the chosen stage 
a .txt with the competitors starting can be generated. Not available in evaluation 
mode. Documented in help </LI><LI>Buttons have been added to the file import preview 
dialog in order to quickly retreive the settings for different known file types.

a selection can be made now in order to print 1/xths of seconds in case of draws 
only instead of always, on time trial classifications. Documented in help </LI><LI>It 
is possible now to add columns to competitors and teams lists indicating competitors 
belonging to masked lists. The indication can be a character string or a html 
tag pointing to an image. Documented in help </LI><LI>It is possible now to suppress 
the missing hardware key dialog on program startup. This setting is made through 
the Options entry in the Tools menu. Documented in help </LI><LI>Cumulative total 
distance is stated now on both stage and general classifications </LI><LI>Speed 
of the classification leader based on the cumulative total distance is stated 
on general classifications </LI><LI>Team codes are provided with an html hot spot 
which links to the particular team in the teams list </LI><LI>An asterisk appearing 
in time trial starting order lists indicates competitors being classified in that 
stage and that the starting order data cannot be changed. Documented in help </LI><LI>An 
asterisk in the title bar caption is indicating now that an opened file has changes 
made to it without having been saved. Not documented explicitly since this is 
a quite common practice in Windows® programming </LI><LI>StageRace web site URL 
in publications' footer is provided with an html hot spot linking to the particular 
site </LI></OL><H3> Optimised </H3><OL><LI VALUE="56">Output files generation 
speed is significantly improved due to direct disk write instead of data buffering 
</LI><LI>It is not possible anymore to remove or otherwise change competitors' 
starting order data after a competitor has been classified in that stage. Documented 
in help </LI><LI>Specifying a particular file type from the import file dialog 
now results in immediate processing instead of popping up with the import classification 
settings and preview dialog. Documented in help </LI><LI>From imported classification 
files only the first 64kb will be read from now on, in order to prevent the system 
from what appears to be a system hangup when (accidently) importing a very large 
file. Documented in help </LI><LI>Number of not started and number remaining after 
race have been added to the classifications. List of riders dropping out now also 
states the number of riders dropping out </LI><LI>Subroutines for generating teams 
and competitors lists have been moved to a more natural location in the design. 
In addition to this and in order to prevent the existence of out of date output, 
both competitor and team lists are generated now when only one of the corresponding 
lists is mutated </LI><LI>Numbers of crossed out competitors are printed between 
brackets on the cross out lists </LI><LI>Stage 1-1 can be fully printed, either 
with or without a hardware key </LI><LI>Decimal point replaced by decimal comma 
for speed representation on classifications </LI><LI>Leaves on the event's tree 
view which do not have a particular functionality (normally accessible by a double 
click) will now toggle there expanded/collapsed state </LI><LI>Dummy Apply buttons 
have been removed from all dialogs </LI><LI>Overlooked keyboard helper marks (underline) 
in dialog function menus added </LI><LI>Additional tracking function <H3> Bugs 
fixed </H3></LI><LI>Calculation of speed on classifications did use the distance 
per round instead of the total race distance (distance per round multiplied by 
number of rounds). This is sorted out now </LI></OL><P> Important note: during 
the development of this version it has become clear that it will not be possible 
to keep the .str file format fully downward compatible in order to stay able to 
read older files. If necessary, conversion utilities can be supplied. This new 
version of the file format will probably be implemented in StageRace V1.07 - 2000.1.07.</P></TD></TR>

the whole event at once, the data is exported to the Lynx.evt event file, as defined 
by Lynx. Incorporated throughout the help. A thorough discussion on the FinishLynx 
file type is omitted so far, awaiting discussion with Lynx System Developers Inc. 
</LI><LI>Through the General Settings dialog a selection can be made now between 
full team names or team codes/abbreviations (as suggested in UCI-regulation 2.2.091) 
to be printed on classifications, this making it more appropriate to publish solely 
the stage classification for single stage events. This setting however involves 
all classifications (stage, general, sprint, climbs). Documented in help </LI><LI>Through 
the Ranking Settings dialog the number of competitors being involved with team 
classifications can be set at 2, 3 and 4, where it was fixed at 3 in the past. 
Documented in help </LI><LI>Through the Presentation Settings dialog printing 
of team names on the cross out lists can now be enabled and disabled. If enabled, 
the number of competitors per team (ergo the number of competitors per printed 
line) can be set. All this because the available solution turned out to be far 
from optimal when f.i. six riders per team together with consecutive numbering 
were applied. Documented in help </LI><LI>Additional to [fix 78] also through 
the Options dialog the path can be chosen now for exporting in the Lynx file type.

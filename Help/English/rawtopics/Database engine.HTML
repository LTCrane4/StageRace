   <P>
      The Microsoft<SUP>&reg;</sup> DAO Jet engine must be installed for StageRace 
      to generate publications.</P>

   <P>
      For this the installation program will install <span class="screenquote">dao350.dll</span> 
      and <span class="screenquote">msjet35.dll</span> into common files and system 
      directories respectively. Also <span class="screenquote">dao350.dll</span> 
      will be registered as a <em>server</em>.</P>

   <P>
      If the engine is already installed on your system, it will not be overwritten. 
      It could be already available through e.g. an installed copy of Microsoft<SUP>&reg;</sup> 
      Access.</P>

   <P>
      The engine is required to retrieve 
      <a href="MultiLanguage.html">
         MultiLanguage</a> strings that are used as captions for generated publications. 
      StageRace will work without the engine, but 
      <a href="Publications.html">
         publications</a> will not appear as desired.</P>

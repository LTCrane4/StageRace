      Ranking Climbing Classifications 
   </H1>

   <P>
      Here the test is described that is done when the competitor <EM>Subject</EM> 
      is compared to the competitor <EM>Test</EM>. This test is part of the 
      <A HREF="Classification%20rules.html">
         uniformed sorting process</A>.</P>

   <H2>
      Formal Description 
   </H2>

   <P>
      The test is described using a flow chart diagram. Flow charts are common 
      tools in engineering and are very appropriate to formally describe a sequence 
      of actions and conditions.</P>

   <P>
   </P>

   <P>
      The test basically answers the question &quot;insert here?&quot; and answers 
      it with a Yes or No (in the circles).</P>

   <P>
      Within the test, decisions are made (in the diamonds), either:</P>

   <UL>
      <LI>In blue: a decision directly based on 
      <A HREF="Settings%20ranking.html">
         ranking settings</A>; or</LI><LI>In black: a decision that compares properties 
      of <EM>Subject</EM> and <EM>Test</EM>.</LI>
   </UL>

   <p>
      The constant value CALCDEPTH_INTERM can be set in the 
      <a href="Settings%20ranking.html">
         ranking settings</a>. It signifies the rank up to which <em>Test</em> 
      and <em>Subject</em> are compared for &quot;Most high rankings&quot; in 
      intermediate sprints.</p>

   <H2>
      Informal Description 
   </H2>

   <P>
   </P>

   <P>
      The diagram lays out that draws (ex equos) in climbing classifications are 
      resolved by looking at:</P>

   <UL>
      <LI>The most high rankings in sprints of category 1*;</LI><LI>The most high 
      rankings in sprints of category 2*;</LI><LI>Etcetera...*; and</LI><LI>The 
      latest half stage ranking or* the latest general classification</LI>
   </UL>

   <p>
   </p>

   <P>
      The initial sort order is the sum of the points from all sprints. </P>

   <P>
   </P>

   <P>
      * indicates dependence on a 
      <A HREF="Settings%20ranking.html">
         ranking setting</A></P>

   <P>
      <EM>Latest</EM> or <EM>all</EM> always refers to only the half stages that 
      have come by, up to and including the half stage for which the sorting is 
      currently done.</P>

   <P>
      <EM>Most high rankings</EM> means comparing the number of first place rankings. 
      If still a draw exists, comparing the number of second place rankings. Then 
      third place rankings. Etcetera.</P>

   <h2>
      Unofficial Classification
   </h2>

   <p>
      Competitors must finish in order to appear in the climbing classification 
      of that stage. When the climbing classification is generated before the 
      end of a stage (thus when no competitors at all have finished yet) the statement 
      &quot;unofficial classification&quot; is printed on the classification.</p>

   <p>
      As soon as competitors start finishing, StageRace only includes those competitors 
      in the general climbing classification which also still exist in the general 
      individual classification.</p>

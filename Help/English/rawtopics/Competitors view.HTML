      When two competitors are selected, they can be swapped trough <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">Swap 
      competitors</SPAN> in the <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">Edit</SPAN> menu. Swapping 
      means that the two competitors exchange start nos. while keeping the rest 
      of their properties (name, team, etcetera).</P>

   <P>
      Swapping can be done between two active competitors, but also between an 
      active competitor and a 
      <A HREF="Competitors%20and%20teams.html#sparecompetitors">
         spare competitor</A>.</P>

   <P>
      This is a very handy function when last-minute a competitor needs replacing 
      by a 
      <A HREF="Competitors%20and%20teams.html#sparecompetitors">
         spare competitor</A>, or to shuffle competitors within a team during 
      registration of the team (or between teams if you would want to).</P>

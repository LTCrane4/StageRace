      Corrections 
   </H1>

   <P>
      After the actual ranking of a half stage, some corrections 
      <A HREF="Corrections.html">
      </A> might be necessary, based on jury decisions.</P>

   <P>
      Corrections are entered as times and for individual competitors.</P>

   <P>
      Corrections are entered in the 
      <A HREF="Corrections%20tab%20sheet.html">
         <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Corrections</SPAN> tab sheet</A> in the 
      <A HREF="Arrival%20dialog.html">
         <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Arrival</SPAN> dialog</A>. </P>

   <H2>
      Bonuses 
   </H2>

   <P>
      A correction bonus may be used to cater for event-specific rules that are 
      not in compliance with the rules that StageRace can apply, of which the 
      <A HREF="UCI%20compliance.html">
         UCI regulations</A> are just a part.</P>

   <P>
      Correction bonus seconds count towards the general individual classification 
      and to the general individual 
      <A HREF="Masking.html">
         masked</A> classifications. Correction bonus seconds that are entered, 
      are usually listed between normal 
      <A HREF="Bonuses.html">
         bonuses</A> on stage classifications; this depending on 
      <A HREF="Settings%20publication.html">
         publication settings</A>.</P>

   <P>
      If your event is in full compliance with the regulations as StageRace handles 
      them, you should never have to use correction bonuses.</P>

   <H2>
      Penalties 
   </H2>

   <P>
      A correction penalty may be used to penalize competitors for foul play.</P>

   <P>
      Correction penalty seconds count towards the general individual classification 
      and to the general individual 
      <A HREF="Masking.html">
         masked</A> classifications. Correction penalty seconds that are entered, 
      are usually listed in a separate column, adjacent to the 
      <A HREF="Bonuses.html">
         bonuses</A> on stage classifications; this depending on 
      <A HREF="Settings%20publication.html">
         publication settings</A>.</P>

   <P>
      The assignment of correction penalties is always the result of a decision 
      of the jury, to cater for disciplinary measures.</P>

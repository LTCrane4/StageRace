      Bonuses 
   </H1>

   <P>
      For every 
      <A HREF="Half%20stages.html">
         half stage</A> you can set up a scheme of bonus seconds.</P>

   <P>
      Bonus seconds are awarded:</P>

   <UL>
      <LI>For the best riders in any intermediate sprints; and</LI><LI>Optionally 
      for the best riders in the stage arrival.</LI>
   </UL>

   <P>
      Bonus seconds count towards the general individual classification and to 
      the general individual 
      <A HREF="Masking.html">
         masked</A> classifications.</P>

   <P>
   </P>

   <P>
      Bonus seconds are usually listed on stage classifications; this depending 
      on 
      <A HREF="Settings%20publication.html">
         publication settings</A>.</P>

   <H2>
      Configuration 
   </H2>

   <P>
      The configuration of bonuses will be done by use of the tab sheet <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Bonuses</SPAN> 
      of the 
      <A HREF="Half%20stages.html">
         configuration of the particular half stage</A>. This can be found through 
      <SPAN CLASS="help_menu"> Configure selection...</SPAN> in the <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">Configuration</SPAN> 
      menu, when the appropriate 
      <A HREF="Half%20stages.html">
         half stage</A> is selected in the 
      <A HREF="Event%20tree.html">
         event tree</A>.</P>

   <P>
         If you want the UCI bonuses scheme for full stages 
         <a href="UCI%20compliance.html">
            <span class="help_uci">(2.6.018)</span></a>, namely 3, 2 and 1 seconds 
         for intermediate sprints and 10, 6 and 4 seconds for the finish, as a 
         starting point, you can get this through the <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Standard 
         UCI</SPAN> button.</P>

   <P>&nbsp;
   </P>

   <P>
      <IMG src="../screenshots/screen18.gif" width="404" height="294" ALT="Configuration of bonuses"></P>

   <P>&nbsp;
   </P>

   <P>
      On the tab sheet there are two lists: <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Interm.</SPAN> 
      and <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Finish</SPAN> to enter the bonus seconds for 
      the intermediate sprints and the stage arrival respectively. The bonus seconds 
      in these lists correspond to the successive rankings, starting from 1.</P>

   <H3>
      Add 
   </H3>

   <P>
      To add bonuses, the number of seconds has to be entered in the field above 
      the particular list and <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Add</SPAN> has to be clicked.</P>

   <P>
      There is no real limit to the amount of bonus entries that you can enter.</P>

   <H3>
      Remove 
   </H3>

   <P>
      If a bonus entry is selected from a list, it can be deleted by clicking 
      <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Remove</SPAN>.</P>

   <H3>
      Number of Sprints 
   </H3>

   <P>
      Also the number of bonus sprints has to be entered. This is including the 
      finish.</P>

   <P>
      Thus, for three intermediate sprints, for instance, a number of 4 should 
      be entered here.</P>

   <P>
      By entering 1 there will only bonuses be assigned during the stage arrival; 
      intermediate sprint bonuses as entered will be ignored.</P>

   <P>
      By entering 0 no bonuses at all will be assigned; bonuses as entered will 
      be ignored</P>

   <P>
      If you only want bonuses to be assigned to intermediate sprints and not 
      to the stage arrival, you enter no points in the <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Finish</SPAN> 
      list. However, you nevertheless have to count the stage arrival for the 
      number of sprints that you enter.</P>

   <P>
      StageRace allows to enter up to 25 sprints, which should be amply sufficient. 
   </P>

      <P>
         Often the appropriate work view for an item will be the

            publication view</A>, displaying the publication that is associated 
         with the selected event item. Note that the root item has the

      Hiding the Tree 
   </H2>

   <P>
      Through <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">Event tree</SPAN> in the <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">View</SPAN>

   <P>
      In the same way a hidden event tree can be shown again.</P>

   <P>&nbsp;
   </P>

   <P>
      Note that the event tree cannot be hidden when the right pane is displaying 
      the 
      <A HREF="Work%20views.html">
         blank work view</A>, because doing so would not make any sense.</P>

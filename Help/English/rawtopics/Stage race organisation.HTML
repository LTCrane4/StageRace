         Stage Race Organization

   <P>
      The following is how stage race events are configured in StageRace.</P>

   <P>
      An event consists of a number of 
      <A HREF="Full%20stages.html">
         full stages or days</A>.</P>

   <P>
      Every full stage consists of one or several 
      <A HREF="Half%20stages.html">
         half stages</A>. This means that also for a day on which only one stage 
      takes place, a full stage with only one half stage within must be constructed. 
      Besides regular half stages, a half stage can also be a 
      <A HREF="Time%20trials.html">
         time trial</A>.</P>

   
<P> For every single half stage you can configure the desired scheme for <A HREF="Bonuses.html"> 
  bonus seconds</A> that counts towards the general classification and the desired 
  points schemes for <A HREF="Sprint%20classifications.html"> sprint</A>, <A HREF="Points%20classifications.html"> 
  points</A>, <A HREF="Climbing%20classifications.html"> climbing</A> and <a href="Most%20aggressive%20rider%20classifications.html">most 
  aggressive rider</a> classifications.</P>

   <P>
      Also you make the overall 
      <A HREF="Settings.html">
         settings</A> for the event.</P>

   <P>&nbsp;
   </P>

   <P>
      Note that anything you change to the configuration of an event is not processed 
      into the publications until they are 
      <A HREF="Generate.html">
         regenerated</A>. This in contrast to when entering data during the race.</P>

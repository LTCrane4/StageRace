         Import Competitors from TT*Ware File Format 
      </H1>

      <P>
         Competitors from TT*Ware can be imported in StageRace so they can be 
         used as a 
         <A HREF="Time%20trial%20arrival%20tab%20sheet.html">
            time trial arrival</A>.</P>

      <P>
         In contrary to the other supported import/export formats, TT*Ware is 
         specifically applicable to 
         <A HREF="Time%20trials.html">
            time trials</A>.</P>

   <P>
      Note that you can also 
         <A HREF="Export%20TTWare%20file%20format.html">
            export files for TT*Ware<SUP></SUP></A>.</P>

      Introduction 
   </H2>

      <P>
         Broder's Skunkware (U.S.A.) develops custom IP-enabled, client-server 
         scoring and timing systems and broadcast graphics solutions for live 
         and live-to-tape sporting events.</P>

      <P>
         Their TT*Ware software allows for real-time support during time trials.</P>

      <P>
         In cooperation with Phoenix Sports Technology from Pennsylvania, U.S.A., 
         the StageRace program has been made capable to import files from TT*Ware.</P>

   <H2>
      Importing 
   </H2>

   <P>
         Classifications from TT*Ware can be made available in comma separated 
         text format.</P>

      <P>
         This data can be found in the <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">ttcomma2.txt</SPAN> 
         file. This is an intermediate file from TT*Ware. In the future Skunkware 
         is going to enable explicit text file export to which StageRace will 
         be adjusted at the time. This all only influences the Skunkware TT*Ware 
         presets; thus if the file type might change over time, you will still 
         be able to import files from TT*Ware through generic text file import 
         (<SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Text files</SPAN> in the <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Import 
         classification</SPAN> file dialog).</P>

      <P>
         Within StageRace, the 
         <A HREF="Arrival%20tab%20sheet.html">
            <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Arrival</SPAN> tab</A> or 
         <A HREF="Time%20trial%20arrival%20tab%20sheet.html">
            <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Time trial Arrival</SPAN> tab</A> provides 
         file import. In the <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Import classification</SPAN> 
         file dialog the text file that contains the classification data can be 
         picked. Additionally, the file type in this dialog should be set to <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Skunkware 
         TT*Ware Results</SPAN> so that StageRace bypasses the advanced 
         <A HREF="Control%20import%20classification%20dialog.html">
            <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Control import classification</SPAN> dialog</A> 
         and directly imports the TT*Ware data.</P>

   <P>
         For TT*Ware operation, please refer to the appropriate documentation.</P>

   <P>
      StageRace provides for automatically uploading the publications of your 
      event to a web server.</P>

   <P>
      Since StageRace generates its publications as HTML files, they are immediately 
      suitable for use on the internet.</P>

   <H2>
      Upload Settings 
   </H2>

   <P>
      You have to set an URL for the web server, a user name and password combination, 
      and optionally a remote directory for the upload to work. Also you have 
      to explicitly allow uploading. All this in the 
      <A HREF="Settings%20upload.html">
         upload settings</A>.</P>

   <P>
      Uploading is done using FTP (File Transfer Protocol).</P>

   <H2>
      Ways of Uploading 
   </H2>

   <P>
      There are two very distinct ways of uploading:</P>

      <UL>
         <LI CLASS="li_extensive">Through <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">Upload all generated 
         publications...</SPAN> in the <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">Tools</SPAN> menu 
         you can upload all the publications of an event at once. This means that 
         StageRace gets all the HTML files of which the file name corresponds 
         to that of the event's .str file and uploads them. Additionally, a possible 
         <a href="Table%20of%20contents.html#index">
            index.html</a> will be uploaded; or</LI><LI CLASS="li_extensive">Through 
         the 
         <A HREF="Event%20items%20selection.html">
            <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Event item selection</SPAN> dialog</A> that 
         allows for uploading a selected set of publications.</LI>
      </UL>

      <P>
         Note that if your event uses separate 
         <A HREF="Header%20information.html">
            event logo</A> and/or 
         <A HREF="CSS%20support.html">
            style sheet (CSS)</A> files, you will have to upload these manually, 
         using external FTP software.</P>

      <H2>
      Table of Contents as Index 
   </H2>

   <P>
      When <SPAN CLASS="screenquote"> 
      <A HREF="Table%20of%20contents.html#index">
         index.html</A></SPAN> is the file name for the 
      <A HREF="Table%20of%20contents.html">
         table of contents</A> it is not longer possible for StageRace to determine 
      whether the supposed 
      <A HREF="Table%20of%20contents.html">
         table of contents</A> file actually applies to the particular event. 
      There is a risk that you are uploading the wrong <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">index.html</SPAN>. 
      You can prevent this by examining (and possibly 
      <A HREF="Generate.html">
         regenerating</A>) the table of contents. Also you are quite sure when 
      you keep your event and its publications in a separate folder locally.</P>

      Time Trial Starting Order Dialog 
   </H1>

      <P>
         This tab sheet consists of two lists: <EM>available</EM> and <EM>classified</EM> 
         competitors. The list of available competitors consists of all competitors 
         who were not 
         <A HREF="Sign%20outs.html">
            signed out</A> neither dropped out at the start of the particular 
         stage. That is also why this starting order can only be drawn up after 
         the previous stage has finished.</P>

      <P>
         If this is a half stage higher than 1 within a certain stage, and the 
         previous half stage has not yet been ridden (i.e. no competitors exist 
         in the previous half stage's arrival dialog) the arrived competitors 
         from the previous full stage are shown here as available and can be used 
         to set up an order. The competitors however, will not show up for ranking 
         in this half stage until finished in the previous half stage (that was 
         empty while setting up the starting order).</P>

   <P>
      When competitors are already classified in the time trial to which a starting 
      list applies, their starting time cannot be altered anymore. These competitors 
      are marked in the list with an asterisk in the <span class="screenquote">Ranked</span> 
      column.</P>

      Competitors can move from the <EM>available</EM> list to the <EM>classified</EM> 
      list by entering their start no., starting order and starting time. When 
      <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Submit</SPAN> is clicked, the data is submitted 
      and the competitor moves.</P>

   <P>
      You can also select one or multiple competitors in the <EM>classified</EM> 
      list, change their starting times and click <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Submit</SPAN> 
      again to apply the entered starting time to the entire selection.</P>

      Declass.

   <P>
      When you select one or multiple competitors in the <EM>classified</EM> list, 
      and you click <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Declass.</SPAN>, the competitors 
      are moved back to the <EM>available</EM> list.</P>

      <LI> As soon as a rider is classified, automatically the starting order 
      field will be incremented. So when you are entering successively ordered 
      competitors, you only need to enter the start nos. and possibly time (after 
      the first competitor has been entered);</LI><LI>When a rider is clicked 
      in either one of the two lists, its data will be copied into the edit boxes 
      in order to edit it quickly;</LI><LI>A large number of competitors can be

      button; and</LI><LI>Multiple riders from the <EM>classified</EM> list can 
      be selected (while holding down either the Shift or the Ctrl key). All selected 
      riders can be declassed simultaneously. Also all selected riders can be

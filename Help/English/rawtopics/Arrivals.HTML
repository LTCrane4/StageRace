      Preparation

   <P>
      Before you enter the ranking for a stage, and preferably also before the 
      actual finish takes place, you should enter the competitors (i.e. 
      <A HREF="Sign%20outs.html">
         sign outs</A>) that didn't start for the stage, although they had the 
      right to do so after finishing the previous stage.</P>

   <P>
      For 
      <A HREF="Time%20trials.html">
         time trials</A> you also need to enter a 
      <A HREF="Time%20trial%20starting%20order%20dialog.html">
         time trial starting order</A>.</P>

   <H2>
      Arrival 
   </H2>

   <P>
      For every stage, you can enter the rankings for:</P>

   <UL>
      <LI>The 
      <A HREF="Half%20stages.html">
         stage arrival</A>;</LI><LI>The intermediate 
      <A HREF="Bonuses.html">
         bonus sprints</A>;</LI><LI>The sprints for the 
      <A HREF="Sprint%20classifications.html">
         sprint classification</A>; and</LI><LI>The sprints for the 
      <A HREF="Climbing%20classifications.html">
         climbing classification</A>.</LI>
   </UL>

   
<P> Some races use the same sprints for <a href="Bonuses.html"> intermediate bonus 
  sprints</a> and the <a href="Sprint%20classifications.html"> sprint classification</a>, 
  in which case you will have to enter the arrival data twice.</P>
<P>Also, if you've configured a <a href="Most%20aggressive%20rider%20classifications.html">most 
  aggressive rider classification</a> for a particular half stage, through <span class="screenquote">Most 
  aggressive rider competition</span> in the event tree you can enter the rankings 
  for the <a href="Most%20aggressive%20rider%20classifications.html">most aggressive 
  rider classification</a>.</P>

   <P>
      For all these rankings the 
      <A HREF="Arrival%20dialog.html">
         <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Arrival</SPAN> dialog</A> is used.</P>

   <H2>
      Corrections 
   </H2>

   <P>
      After the actual ranking, some 
      <A HREF="Corrections.html">
         corrections</A> might be necessary, based on jury decisions.</P>

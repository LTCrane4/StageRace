   <P>
      StageRace uses its own file type for the storage of all relevant data. The 
      file type can be recognized from the <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">.str</SPAN> 
      extension.</P>

   <P>
      During installation, the file type will be registered in Windows<SUP>®</SUP> 
      in order to allow you to open StageRace automatically by clicking a <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">.str</SPAN> 
      file, anywhere in Windows<SUP>®</SUP>.</P>

   <H2>
      File Functions 
   </H2>

   <P>
      You work with StageRace files just like you are used from many other software 
      applications, using the functions <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">New</SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">Open</SPAN>, 
      <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">Close</SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">Save</SPAN> 
      and <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">Save as...</SPAN> from the <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">File</SPAN> 
      menu.</P>

   <H2>
      <A NAME="workfolder">
      </A>Work Folder 
   </H2>

   <P>
      You can assign one folder as your standard work folder for storing <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">.str</SPAN> 
      files.</P>

   <P>
      During installation, a &quot;My Stage Races&quot; folder will be created 
      inside your &quot;My Documents&quot; folder which will be set as default 
      work folder. If you want to change the default work folder, you can do this 
      in the Options dialog, which can be found through <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">Options</SPAN> 
      in the <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">Tools</SPAN> menu.</P>

   <P>
      From within <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Open</SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Save 
      as</SPAN> dialogs you can browse to your own work folder by a single click 
      on the <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Browse to work folder</SPAN> button.</P>

      Examples 
   </H2>

   <P>
      A number of example <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">.str</SPAN> files always come 
      with the StageRace distribution. During installation, the example files 
      are copied into the work folder that is created during installation. With 
      these examples also come all the associated publications.</P>

   <P>
      Note that all example files are set to read-only.</P>

      <A NAME="fileversion">
      </A>File Versions 
   </H2>

   <P>
         The internal layout of <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">.str</SPAN> files has 
         been changed over time. The current version of the file type is <EM>fV2030</EM>.</P>

   <P>
      Files saved with a certain version of StageRace can <EM>not</EM> be opened 
      in StageRace versions that were designed for older file versions. In your 
      current version of StageRace, however, you can open files from StageRace 
      2000.1.07 and any newer version. Note that once you save your old file, 
      it will be saved in the new file format. An advance warning is given. Also 
      a warning is given when you are opening an older type of file.</P>

   <P>
      The version number of a file at the time that it was opened is displayed 
      in the 
      <A HREF="Status%20bar.html">
         status bar</A>.</P>

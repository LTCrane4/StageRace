         When the small size of the control holds you back from properly making 
         the settings, you can maximize the control in which you make these settings, 
         by double-clicking on any whitespace in the control.</P>

      Enter:</P>

   <UL>
      <LI>The 
      <A HREF="Rules%20teams%20classifications.html">
         bunch size</A> for teams classifications; at least 2 and at most 6; and</LI><LI>The 
      rank (depth) up to which &quot;Most high rankings&quot; calculations must 
      be done; this way making a trade-off between calculation speed and accuracy. 
      However, when the number set for <span class="screenquote">Stage arrivals</span> 
      is larger than the last ranking that you expect (normally the number of 
      competitors in the race), and the number set for <span class="screenquote">Intermediate 
      sprints</span> is larger than the maximum amount of points that is awarded 
      for any involved sprint, you have optimal accuracy guaranteed.</LI>

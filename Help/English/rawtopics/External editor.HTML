   <P>
      Through <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">Edit publication externally</SPAN> in the 
      <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">Tools</SPAN> menu, you can launch the editor of 
      <A HREF="Options.html">
         your choice</A> for editing the publication for which the 
      <A HREF="Event%20tree.html">
         event tree</A> item is currently selected. You can choose the desired 
      editor through <SPAN CLASS="help_menu"> 
      <A HREF="Options.html">
         Options</A></SPAN> in the <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">Tools</SPAN> menu. 
      By default the editor is set to the Microsoft<SUP>&reg;</SUP> Notepad.</P>

   <P>
      You might want to use this function if your event uses very particular and 
      unusual rules for which StageRace cannot cater, or when publications need 
      editing otherwise.</P>

   <P>
      After you manually change a publication, you have to refresh the 
      <A HREF="Publication%20view.html">
         publication view</A> through <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">Refresh</SPAN> in 
      the <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">View</SPAN> menu. Also, you may want to set 
      the particular publication to 
      <A HREF="Generate.html#readonly">
         read-only</A> (through <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">Read-only publication</SPAN> 
      in the <SPAN CLASS="help_menu"> 
      <A HREF="Generate.html">
         Generate</A></SPAN> menu) to prevent your manual changes to be overwritten 
      by StageRace.</P>

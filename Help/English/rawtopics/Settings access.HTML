      With protection it is not longer possible to alter the main characteristics 
      of an event. This can be desirable to enforce a good

         division of tasks</A> between 
      <A HREF="Stage%20race%20organisation.html">

         administration</A> of an event, as described elsewhere.</P>

      The following access settings can be made:</P>

   </P>

   <P>
      Set the configuration access to:</P>

   <UL>
      <LI> Free;</LI><LI>Only for users that have the correct password; or</LI><LI>Only 
      when the hardware key is connected that is connected at this time.</LI>
   </UL>

   <P>
      Enter:</P>

   <UL>
      <LI> The password when access through password is selected</LI>
   </UL>

      Note that the protection of the document is only a protection of the configuration 
      settings. Data input and processing will remain possible as normal.</P>

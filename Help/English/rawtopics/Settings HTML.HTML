      Note that this section particularly covers HTML specific markup, rather 
      than the content for publications which is covered by the

         publication settings</A>.</P>

   <P>
      The following HTML settings can be made:</P>

   <P>
      Set:</P>

      <UL>
         <LI>Choose if the 
         <A HREF="Table%20of%20contents.html">
            table of contents</A> must be generated as <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">index.html</SPAN> 
         or with a name based on the event title, like with all other publications;</LI><LI>Choose 
         if the markup is generated by StageRace or depends on an 
         <A HREF="CSS%20support.html">
            external style sheet</A> for which a link can be provided;</LI><LI>Choose 
         the desired 
         <A HREF="Publications.html#characterset">
            character set</A> to generate HTML in, choosing from both fifteen 
         ISO sets as well as ten Windows sets. (This will be superseeded in the 
         future by the implementation of Unicode support.)</LI>
      </UL>

   <P>
      Enter:</P>

   <UL>
      <LI>The colors that are used for various elements in publications;</LI><LI>A 
      link to a logo that must be used in publications; and</LI><LI>A link to 
      a 
      <A HREF="CSS%20support.html">
         CSS (cascaded style sheet) file that lays down the markup</A> for replacing 
      the standard StageRace markup.</LI>
   </UL>

      <P>
         Note that some colors that you can choose might look good on screen but 
         are very hazy when printed.</P>

      <P>
         Note that when you provide a link, you should provide a sufficiently 
         qualified URL or path. You can just enter the file name, in which case 
         the file is assumed to be in the same folder as the publications. But 
         you can also enter a full internet address of the file or an directory 
         path to it. Note that when you provide a local or even networked directory 
         path, the file is likely not to be accessible when other users view your 
         publications over the internet.</P>

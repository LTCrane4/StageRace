  can edit the settings that specifically apply to the the generation of HTML 
  files.</P>
<P>When the small size of the settings control holds you back from properly making

<P> Note that this section particularly covers HTML specific markup of documents, 
  rather than the content for publications which is covered by the <A HREF="Settings%20publication.html"> 
  publication settings</A>.</P>
<P>The following HTML settings can be made.</P>
<h2>Style</h2>
<p>You can select if style information should be embedded in generated documents, 
  or that an <a href="CSS%20support.html">external style sheet (CSS)</a> must 
  be referenced, for which you then can enter the file name.</p>
<p>When using the embedded style information, you can choose the body font to 
  be with serif (e.g. Times) or sans-serif (e.g. Arial) and whether fonts should 
  have fixed or relative sizes. Relative sized fonts can be resized in the <a href="Publication%20view.html">publication 
  view</a>. Also the total set of standard StageRace font sizes can already be 
  changed percentually. Additionally, you can choose the column with UCI codes 
  to be printed in a fixed width font, because that is an often appreciated look 
  for this column, because the alignment that can be achieved.</p>
<p>You can select the colors for various elements in documents, and set the file 
  name of the event's logo to be printed at the top of documents. Note that some 
  colors that you can choose might look good on screen but are very hazy when 
  printed. Colors can be chosen from a drop-down list, or entered as RGB (#RRGGBB) 
  values. </p>
<p>You can set the number of pixels between the columns in documents.</p>
<p>Note that when you provide a link, you should provide a sufficiently qualified 
  URL or path. You can just enter the file name, in which case the file is assumed 
  to be in the same folder as the generated documents. But you can also enter 
  a full internet address of the file or an directory path to it. Note that when 
  you provide a local or even networked directory path, the file is likely not 
  to be accessible when other users view your publications over the internet.</p>
<h2>Custom HTML</h2>
<p>You can enter blocks of HTML (or text) to be printed, one for the top and one 
  for the bottom of the document. You can find countless sources such as on the 
  internet that more thoroughly discuss HTML and its tags.</p>
<p>You can choose whether any custom HTML that you've entered must be printed 
  on every page, or only on the first page (for custom HTML entered for <span class="screenquote">Top</span>) 
  or the last page (for custom HTML entered for <span class="screenquote">Bottom</span>).</p>
<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
<p>Choose if the <A HREF="Table%20of%20contents.html"> table of contents</A> must 
  be generated as <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">index.html</SPAN> or with a name based 
  on the event title, like with all other publications.</p>
<p>Choose if empty dummy documents must be generated for when no data are (yet) 
  available for particular publications. Such publications only consist of an 
  identification of the item plus a message indicating that no appropriate data 
  was available.</p>
<p>Choose if team codes throughout publications must hyperlink back to the competitors 
  list on teams.</p>
<p>Choose if full documents must be in <A HREF="Unicode.html"> 
  Unicode</A> or that only non-ANSI characters must be encoded in the HTML.</p>

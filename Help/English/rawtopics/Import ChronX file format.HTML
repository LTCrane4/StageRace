      Introduction 
   </H2>

   <P>
      AMB i.t. specializes in the design, manufacturing and support of sports 
      timing and scoring systems.</P>

   <P>
      Their Cyclip system is specifically designed for the identification and 
      timing during cycling events. For an unlimited number of competitors it 
      is possible to give positions, best lap times, numbers, names etc. This 
      information can be presented on a scoreboard, computer or TV screen and 
      can be printed during and after the race or practice.</P>

   <P>
      ChronX is AMB's timing software for both professional and club racing. It 
      is designed for use with all TranX Pro systems, Tranx260, TranX160, AMB130 
      and Cyclip systems.</P>

   <P>
      In cooperation with AMB the StageRace program has been made to import files 
      from ChronX.</P>

   <H2>
      Importing 
   </H2>

   <P>
      As further described in the ChronX User Manual, text file export is possible, 
      which can be used for classification generation in StageRace.</P>

   <P>
      A <EM>run</EM> should be selected within ChronX and <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">Current 
      Race Results</SPAN> being chosen from the menus. A file name can then be 
      chosen.</P>

   <P>
      Within StageRace, the 
      <A HREF="Arrival%20tab%20sheet.html">
         <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Arrival</SPAN> tab</A> provides file import. 
      In the <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Import classification</SPAN> file dialog 
      the text file that contains the classification data can be picked. Additionally, 
      the file type in this dialog should be set to <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">AMB 
      ChronX Results</SPAN> so that StageRace bypasses the advanced 
      <A HREF="Control%20import%20classification%20dialog.html">
         <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Control import classification</SPAN> dialog</A> 
      and directly imports the ChronX data.</P>

   <P>
      For ChronX operation, please refer to the appropriate documentation.</P>

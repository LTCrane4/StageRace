      text format.</P>

   <P>

      <A HREF="Arrival%20tab%20sheet.html">
         <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Arrival</SPAN> tab</A> provides file import. 
      In the <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Import classification</SPAN> file dialog 
      the text file that contains the classification data can be picked. Additionally, 
      the file type in this dialog should be set to <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Alge 
      OPTIc Results</SPAN> so that StageRace bypasses the advanced 
      <A HREF="Control%20import%20classification%20dialog.html">

      and directly imports the OPTIc data.</P>

      Climbing Classifications 
   </H1>

   <P>
      For every 
      <A HREF="Half%20stages.html">
         half stage</A> you can set up a scheme of points for the climbing classification.</P>

   <P>
      Climbing points are awarded for intermediate sprints that specifically take 
      place on hills or mountains.</P>

   <P>
      In a climbing classification, the amount of difficulty of the location of 
      the sprint is taken into account. Therefore, for each 
      <A HREF="Half%20stages.html">
         half stage</A> you can enter points schemes for up to four categories, 
      which each correspond to a certain grade of difficulty.</P>

   <P>
      Once you have determined the existing categories for a 
      <A HREF="Half%20stages.html">
         half stage</A> and the matching points schemes, you have to lay down 
      the order in which categories are used.</P>

   <P>
      For example, imagine a 
      <A HREF="Half%20stages.html">
         half stage</A> using three categories of climbing difficulty. The first 
      climbing sprint in the race will be of the middle category, the second of 
      the most difficult category, then one of the middle category again and finally 
      one of the least hard category. This could require the following data to 
      be entered:</P>

         Note that if you do not use all four available categories, you do not 
         necessarily need to use consecutive categories.</P>

   <P>
      The sum of these points from every 
      <A HREF="Half%20stages.html">
         half stage</A> will be used to calculate a general individual climbing 
      classification from. This classification is independent from the actual 
      stage classification. However, for a competitor to appear in the climbing 
      classification, he/she must successfully complete the 
      <A HREF="Half%20stages.html">
         half stage</A>.</P>

   <P>
      For climbing classifications a separate publication is generated, which 
      lists all the intermediate sprint results as well as the general sprint 
      classification.</P>

   <H2>
      Configuration 
   </H2>

   <P>
      The configuration of climbing points will be done by use of the tab sheet 
      <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Climbing classification</SPAN> of the 
      <A HREF="Half%20stages.html">
         configuration of the particular half stage</A>. This can be found through 
      <SPAN CLASS="help_menu"> Configure selection...</SPAN> in the <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">Configuration</SPAN> 
      menu, when the appropriate 
      <A HREF="Half%20stages.html">
         half stage</A> is selected in the 
      <A HREF="Event%20tree.html">
         event tree</A>.</P>

   <P>&nbsp;
   </P>

   <P>
      On the tab sheet there are five lists: <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Cat. 1</SPAN> 
      through <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Cat. 4</SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Order</SPAN>. 
      The sprint points in the category lists correspond to the successive rankings, 
      starting from 1. The numbers in the <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Order</SPAN> 
      list correspond to the categories (1 through 4), laying down the order in 
      which categories are used.</P>

   <H3>
      Add Points 
   </H3>

   <P>
      To add climbing sprint points, the number of points has to be entered in 
      the field above the particular list and <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Add</SPAN> 
      has to be clicked.</P>

   <P>
      There is no real limit to the amount of climbing sprint points entries that 
      you can enter.</P>

   <H3>
      Remove Points 
   </H3>

   <P>
      If a climbing sprint points entry is selected from a list, it can be deleted 
      by clicking <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Remove</SPAN>.</P>

   <H3>
      Add Category Use 
   </H3>

   <P>
      To add the use of a category, the category number has to be entered in the 
      field above the <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Order</SPAN> list and <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Add</SPAN> 
      has to be clicked.</P>

   <P>
      StageRace allows to enter up to 25 category uses, which should be amply 
      sufficient. </P>

   <H3>
      Remove Category Use 
   </H3>

   <P>
      If a category number entry is selected from the <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Order</SPAN> 
      list, it can be deleted by clicking <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Remove</SPAN>.</P>

   <P>
      If the amount of categories used is zero, the <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Climbing 
      classification</SPAN> item will subsequently be removed from the 
      <A HREF="Event%20tree.html">
         event tree</A>.</P>

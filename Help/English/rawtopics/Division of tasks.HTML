      Division of Tasks 
   </H1>

   <P>
      It is a good thing to make a division into the following tasks, and also 
      in the moment on which these tasks are executed:</P>

   <UL>
      <LI CLASS="li_extensive"> 
      <A HREF="Stage%20race%20organisation.html">
            <EM>Configuring of an event</EM><BR>(stage race organization)</A><BR>This 
         can be done in the days preceding the event, in cooperation with an organization 
         representative.</LI><LI CLASS="li_extensive"> 
         <A HREF= "Race%20administration.html">
            <EM>Utilization of an event</EM><BR>(race administration)</A><BR>This 
         takes place during the various stages, in cooperation with the members 
         of the jury which are present.</LI>
   </UL>

   <P>
      You can enforce a division of tasks by locking the 
      <A HREF="Stage%20race%20organisation.html">
         configuration of the event</A> through the 
      <A HREF="Settings%20access.html">
         access settings</A>. That way you can prevent administrators that handle 
      the race from changing the race's configuration.</P>

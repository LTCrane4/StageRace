      Prologue 
   </H1>

   <P>
      In the 
      <A HREF="Settings%20general.html">
         general settings</A> you can set an event to start with a prologue 
      <a href="UCI%20compliance.html">
         <span class="help_uci">(2.6.005 and 2.6.022)</span></a>. 

   <P>
      If your event is set to start with a prologue: 

   <UL>
      <LI CLASS="li_extensive">The 
      <A HREF="Full%20stages.html">
         stage</A> numbering is as follows: P, 1, 2, etcetera;</LI><LI CLASS="li_extensive">The 
      <A HREF="Half%20stages.html">
         half stage</A> numbering within the P stage is as follows: P, 2, 3, etcetera; 
      and</LI><LI CLASS="li_extensive">The prologue (half stage) will not count 
      towards the total distance that can be printed on general classifications.</LI>
   </UL>

   <p>
      Indication of prologues is abbreviated to the letter P.</p>

   <p>&nbsp;
   </p>

   <P>
      Note that as a result the distance on the general classification after the 
      prologue will show zero, if distance is selected for printing.</P>

   <P>
      Also note that it is very unlikely to have a half stage 2 or on when a prologue 
      is ridden in a full stage.</P>

      <P>
         However a prologue is typically a time trial, you are not forced to configure 
         this as such. In other words: you event could start with a normal half 
         stage even when the event is set to start with a prologue. 

      <P>
         Note that 
         <A HREF="Export%20ScanOVision%20file%20format.html">
            Scan'O'Vision</A> and 
         <A HREF="Export%20FinishLynx%20file%20format.html">
            FinishLynx</A> output will have stage numbering as if no prologue 
         was selected.

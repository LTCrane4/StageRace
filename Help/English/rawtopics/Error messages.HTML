      Error messages 
   </H1>

   <P>
      Of course it is always a bad thing to happen when a computer application 
      stops early and quits with a (usually vague) error message.</P>

   <P>
      To turn such unpleasant experience into at least something positive, we 
      kindly request you to log all details in such situations, to help fixing 
      the cause in future versions.</P>

   <P>&nbsp;
   </P>

   <P>
      Sending can be done to 
      <A HREF="Totaal software.html">
         our snail-mail address</A> or at 
      <A HREF=mailto:development@stagerace.com?subject=Bugreport>
         development@stagerace.com</A> directly. </P>

   <P>
      A brief message is given, but through <span class="screenquote">Details</span> 
      you can get more information on the error message.</P>

   <P>
      Select the contents of the details window and copy them to the clipboard.</P>

   <P>
      Paste the clipboard contents to a text file or e-mail and send the printed 
      text file or the e-mail to Totaal Software.</P>

   <H2>
      In Windows<SUP>®</SUP> NT/2000 
   </H2>

   <P>
      An error message is given with at least one so-called hexadecimal number 
      (recognized from the "0x" at the front of the numbers).</P>

   <P>
      File at least all hexadecimal numbers (for instance <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">0x00416320</SPAN>), 
      but preferably the entire message and send it to Totaal Software.</P>

   <h2>
      In Windows<sup>®</sup> XP
   </h2>

   <p>
      A message dialog is given (for instance saying &quot;<span class="screenquote">StageRace.exe 
      has encountered a problem and needs to close</span>&quot;), and through 
      <span class="screenquote">click here</span> you can get more information 
      on the error message.</p>

   <p>
      File the (five) details from the <span class="screenquote">Error signature</span> 
      and send it to Totaal Software.</p>

   <p>
      We suggest you choose <span class="screenquote">Don't Send</span> in the 
      main error message dialog.</p>

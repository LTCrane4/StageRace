      Error messages

   <P>
      Of course it is always a bad thing to happen when a computer application 
      stops early and quits with a (usually vague) error message.</P>

   
<P> To turn such unpleasant experience into at least something positive, we kindly 
  request you to log all details in such situations, to help fixing the cause 
  in future versions. Sending can be done to <A HREF="Totaal software.html"> our 
  snail-mail address</A> or at <A HREF=mailto:development@stagerace.com?subject=Bugreport> 
  development@stagerace.com</A> directly.</P>

   
<P>In Windows<SUP>&reg;</SUP> XP, in case of an error, a message dialog is given 
  (for instance saying &quot;<span class="screenquote">StageRace.exe has encountered 
  a problem and needs to close</span>&quot;), and through <span class="screenquote">click 
  here</span> you can get more information on the error message.</P>

   <p>
      File the (five) details from the <span class="screenquote">Error signature</span> 
      and send it to Totaal Software.</p>

   <p>
      We suggest you choose <span class="screenquote">Don't Send</span> in the 
      main error message dialog.</p>

   <P>
      While <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">Automatically</SPAN> in the <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">Generate</SPAN> 
      menu is checked (switched on), StageRace automatically generates all publications 
      for you, whenever you enter any data during the event. (Note that changes 
      to the 
      <A HREF="Stage%20race%20organisation.html">
         configuration</A> do not trigger the immediate regeneration of publications.)</P>

   <P>
      You can however, through the Generate menu, choose to generate or regenerate 
      the desired publications.</P>

   <P>
      The following functions are available for generating a specific type of

      Old Publications 
   </H2>

   <P>
      Note that StageRace only generates publications for which content exists. 
      So if ever e.g. a half stage classification or a communiqu&eacute; is generated 
      as publication, the resulting files will remain to exist. Even when you 
      empty the arrival (so that no new publication for this is generated anymore) 
      or delete the communiqu&eacute;, the file will stay until you remove it 
      manually. This means that StageRace might also display such old publications 
      in the 
      <A HREF="Publication%20view.html">
         publication view</A> at some moment.</P>

   <P>
      You may want to print 
      <a href="Footer%20information.html">
         time stamps on publications</a> in order to see how old a publication 
      is. </P>

   <H2>
      <A NAME="readonly">
      </A>Read-only 
   </H2>

   <P>
      Through <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">Read-only publication</SPAN> in the <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">Generate</SPAN> 
      menu, you can determine whether or not a publication can be overwritten 
      by StageRace.</P>

   <P>
      When StageRace encounters an existing publication that it cannot regenerate 
      due to the read-only flag, an error message will be displayed.</P>

   <H2>
      Edit Publication Externally 
   </H2>

   <P>
      StageRace allows to edit publications in an 
      <A HREF="External%20editor.html">
         external editor</A> of your choice.</P>

      Table of Contents 
   </H1>

   <P>
      You can generate a table of contents through <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">Table 
      of contents</SPAN> in the <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">Generate</SPAN> menu.</P>

   <P>
      The table of contents includes references (hyperlinks) to all the publications 
      that are part of the event (except for 
      <a href="Sign%20in%20lists.html">
         sign in lists</a>).</P>

   <P>
      However, if you use 
      <A HREF="Communiqu%E9%20numbering.html">
         communiqu&eacute; numbering</A>, only the publications that are yet 
      <A HREF="Communiqu%E9%20numbering.html">
         published</A> are included in the table of contents.</P>

   <H2>
      <A NAME="index">
      </A>Index File 
   </H2>

   <P>
      The table of contents can be generated with a file name that differs from 
      the 
      <A HREF="Publication%20names.html">
         naming convention</A> that is used for all other publications. It can 
      be <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">index.html</SPAN>. This way, when uploading 
      your event's publications to a dedicated directory on your web server, the 
      event will be easily accessible over the internet by only using this directory's 
      name (depending on server configuration). You can set this in the 
      <A HREF="Settings%20HTML.html">
         HTML settings</A>.</P>

   <P>
      When <span class="screenquote"> index.html</span> is used
      <a href="Table%20of%20contents.html">
      </a> it is not longer possible for StageRace to determine whether a supposed 
      table of contents file actually applies to the particular event. There is 
      a risk that it uses a wrong <span class="screenquote">index.html</span> 
      for e.g. 
      <a href="Publication%20view.html">
         printing</a>, 
      <a href="Upload.html">
         uploading</a> or displaying in the 
      <a href="Event%20tree.html">
         event tree</a>. You can prevent this by examining (and possibly 
      <a href="Generate.html">
         regenerating</a>) the table of contents. Also you are quite sure when 
      you keep your event and its publications in a separate folder locally.</P>

      Lynx System Developers, Inc. from Massachusetts, U.S.A., is a privately-owned 
      company that supplies the latest results generation and handling technologies 
      to the sporting industry. The company employs software and hardware engineers 
      and has its own production division to meet the growing worldwide demand 
      for the Lynx range of digital sports data generation tools.</P>

   <P>
      FinishLynx<SUP>&reg;</SUP> is their popular photo finish and timing system. 
      For instance, various of these systems are used at <EM>le Tour de France</EM> 
      for intermediate timing as well as for the finishes.</P>

   <P>
      The StageRace program has been made capable to import files from FinishLynx<SUP>&reg;</SUP>.</P>

   <P>
      Classifications made in FinishLynx<SUP>®</SUP> are available automatically 
      in comma-delimited text format (when using the default settings). </P>

   <P>
      This data can be found in a <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">.lif</SPAN> file of 
      which the name is equal to the one of the event (<SPAN CLASS="screenquote">.evn</SPAN>) 
      that is the subject.</P>

   <P>
      Within StageRace, the 
      <A HREF="Arrival%20tab%20sheet.html">
         <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Arrival</SPAN> tab</A> provides file import. 
      In the <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Import classification</SPAN> file dialog 
      the text file that contains the classification data can be picked. Additionally, 
      the file type in this dialog should be set to <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Lynx 
      FinishLynx Results</SPAN> so that StageRace can retrieve the appropriate 
      settings for the advanced 
      <A HREF="Control%20import%20classification%20dialog.html">
         <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Control import classification</SPAN> dialog</A>.</P>

   <P>
   </P>

   <P>
      Since time precision is dependent on software settings, the layout of the 
      <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">.lif</SPAN> files is slightly varying and so they 
      have to be imported through the 
      <A HREF="Control%20import%20classification%20dialog.html">
         <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Control import classification</SPAN> dialog</A>.</P>

   <P>
      For FinishLynx<SUP>®</SUP> operation, please refer to the appropriate documentation.</P>

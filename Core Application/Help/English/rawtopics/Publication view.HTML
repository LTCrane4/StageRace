<P> If in the <A HREF="Event%20tree.html"> event tree</A> an item is selected 
  that has a publication associated with it, the publication view will be visible, 
  displaying this publication. However, if the publication is not actually generated 
  yet, a blank view is displayed rather than the publication view. The exact publication 
  that is shown also depends on the currently set <a href="Profiles.html">profile</a>.</P>

   <P>
      <a href="Publications.html">
         Publications</a> are in the form of separate HTML files, which is the 
      leading internet document file type. Therefore the publication view is in 
      fact an internet browser.</P>

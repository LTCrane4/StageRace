      StageRace Messaging Protocol 
   </H1>

   <P>
      The StageRace Messaging protocol allows for external (third-party) programs 
      to communicate with StageRace in real-time. This way general competitor 
      information as well as rankings can be read and also rankings can be set, 
      where rankings do include race times.</P>

   <P>
      Only if you are a programmer or are otherwise involved in the application 
      of a third-party program that is enabled to communicate with StageRace, 
      this information can be of interest for you.</P>

   <P>
      The Messaging protocol is based on the 
      <A HREF="Messaging%20techniques.html">
         window messaging system</A> and a number of 
      <A HREF="Message%20definitions.html">
         StageRace specific messages</A> has been specified.</P>

   <P>
      When StageRace is opened, you have to ensure that the right StageRace document 
      is opened and set as the 
      <A HREF="Select%20active%20event%20window.html">
         active event</A> for the 'outsiders' to communicate with.</P>

   <P>
      If actual communication takes place, an icon in the 
      <a href="Status%20bar.html">
         status bar</a> lights up for every message that is sent.</P>

   <P>
      Note that the StageRace Messaging protocol is part of the StageRace product 
      and therefore falls under its 
      <A HREF="../License.html" class="screenquote">
         License agreement</A>.</P>

      UCI Compliance 
   </H1>

   <P>
      During the design of StageRace, there was no official contacts with the 
      International Cycling Union (UCI). Nevertheless, StageRace is fully compliant 
      to recent UCI rules.</P>

   <h2>
      Rules References
   </h2>

   <P>
      Wherever appropriate in this Help system the UCI rules are referred to. 
      This is done by stating the number of the relevant article(s) between brackets 
      with markup as demonstrated below:</P>

   <BLOCKQUOTE> 
   <P CLASS="help_uci">
      (2.2.090)</P>

   </BLOCKQUOTE>
   <P>
      References always concern articles from <EM>part II Road Races</EM> from 
      the <EM>UCI Cycling Regulations</EM>. The latest UCI regulations can be 
      downloaded from their website at 
      <A HREF="http://www.uci.ch" TARGET="_blank">
         http://www.uci.ch</A>.</P>

   <h2>
      Involved UCI Rules
   </h2>

   <P>
      StageRace has been brought fully up to date with the 2003 regulations.</P>

   <P>
         Single exception to the latter is that the highest rankings of teams 
         in daily teams classifications are not taken into consideration <SPAN CLASS="help_uci">(2.6.016, 
         2nd paragraph, 2nd sentence: &quot;In the event of a tie, the following 
         criteria shall be applied in order until the teams are separated: 1. 
         Number of first places in daily team classifications 2. Number of second 
         places ... Etc.&quot;)</SPAN>. However, the ranking rules that are available 
         should be amply sufficient to perform teams classifications in a satisfactory 
         manner. The available rules give a sufficient depth of solving ties.</P>

   <h2>
      Additional Rules
   </h2>

   <P>
      In addition to the bare minimal set of rules that the UCI regulations provide, 
      a lot of ruling practices are obtained from other sources.</P>

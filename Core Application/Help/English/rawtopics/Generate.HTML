   </H1>

   
<P> While <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">Automatically</SPAN> in the <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">Generate</SPAN> 
  menu is checked (switched on), StageRace automatically generates all publications 
  for you, whenever you enter any data during the event. (Note that changes to 
  the <A HREF="Stage%20race%20organisation.html"> configuration</A> do not trigger 
  the immediate regeneration of publications.) You can however, through the Generate 
  menu, choose to generate or regenerate the desired publications.</P>
<h2>Background Generating</h2>
<P>Publications are always generated in the <em>background</em>. This means that 
  you can continue what you were doing in the foreground. This is convenient anyhow, 
  but also important, if you use StageRace in a distributed environment with the 
  <a href="Server.html">StageRace Server</a>. In this situation it is not necessarely 
  always you yourself who triggers the publication generation.</P>
<P>The progress of background publications generation is shown in a progress bar 
  in the <a href="Status%20bar.html">status bar</a>. StageRace is able to restart 
  the generation process when you (or an incoming request of the <a href="Server.html">StageRace 
  Server</a>) re-requests the same generation process before it was finished.</P>
<P>If publications are regenerated in the background while visible in the <a href="Publication%20view.html">publication 
  view</a>, the view will be refreshed and its scroll position will conveniently 
  be restored. This also applies to <a href="Monitoring.html">monitoring</a>.</P>

   <h2>Generate Menu Functions</h2>

   <P>
      The following functions are available for generating a specific type of 
      document for the entire event:</P>

   <UL>
      <LI><SPAN CLASS="help_menu"> 
      <A HREF="Table%20of%20contents.html">
         Table of contents</A></SPAN>&nbsp;</LI><LI><SPAN CLASS="help_menu"> Communiqu&eacute;s</SPAN>&nbsp;</LI><LI><SPAN CLASS="help_menu"> 
      Competitors lists</SPAN>&nbsp;</LI><LI><SPAN CLASS="help_menu">

         Cross out lists</A></SPAN>&nbsp;</LI><LI><SPAN CLASS="help_menu"> 
      <a href="Sign%20in%20lists.html">
         Sign in lists</a></SPAN>&nbsp;</LI>
   </UL>

   <P>
      The following functions are also available:</P>

   <UL>
      <LI CLASS=" li_extensive"><SPAN CLASS="help_menu">Selection</SPAN><BR> Generates 
      the document that is associated with the currently selected 
      <A HREF="Event%20tree.html">

      stages and dependencies</SPAN><BR> Generates all the half stages publications 
      and underlying publications for the entire event</LI><LI CLASS=" li_extensive"><SPAN CLASS="help_menu">All</SPAN><BR> 
      Generates all the publications for the entire event </LI>
   </UL>

   <H2>
      Old Publications 
   </H2>

   
<P> Note that StageRace only generates publications for which content exists. 
  So if ever e.g. a half stage classification or a communiqu&eacute; is generated 
  as publication, the resulting files will remain to exist. Even when you empty 
  the arrival (so that no new publication for this is generated anymore) or delete 
  the communiqu&eacute;, the file will stay until you remove it manually. This 
  means that StageRace might also display such old publications in the <A HREF="Publication%20view.html"> 
  publication view</A> at some moment. However, you can also select in the <a href="Settings%20HTML.html">HTML 
  settings</a> that dummy documents must be generated for when no data are (yet) 
  available for particular publications.</P>

   <P>
      You may want to print 
      <a href="Footer%20information.html">
         time stamps on publications</a> in order to see how old a publication 
      is. </P>

   <H2>
      <A NAME="readonly">
      </A>Read-only 
   </H2>

   <P>
      Through <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">Read-only publication</SPAN> in the <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">Generate</SPAN> 
      menu, you can determine whether or not a publication can be overwritten 
      by StageRace.</P>

   <P>
      When StageRace encounters an existing publication that it cannot regenerate 
      due to the read-only flag, an error message will be displayed.</P>

   <H2>
      Edit Publication Externally 
   </H2>

   <P>
      StageRace allows to edit publications in an 
      <A HREF="External%20editor.html">
         external editor</A> of your choice.</P>

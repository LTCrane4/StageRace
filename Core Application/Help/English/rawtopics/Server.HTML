<H1> StageRace Server</H1>

   
<P> The StageRace Server functionality allows for external (third-party) programs 
  to communicate with StageRace in real-time. This way general competitor information 
  as well as rankings can be read and also rankings can be set, where rankings 
  do include race times.</P>

   <P>
      Only if you are a programmer or are otherwise involved in the application 
      of a third-party program that is enabled to communicate with StageRace, 
      this information can be of interest for you.</P>

   
<P> The StageRace server is a D-COM component that exposes a number of interfaces 
  and coclasses for the following logical classes:</P>
<ul>
  <li><em>SRHalfStage</em>: set or reset arrival information, enumerate time trial 
    starting information </li>
  <li><em>StageRaceDoc</em>: enumerate (half) stages and competitor information</li>
  <li><em>StageraceServer</em>: enumerate open documents and send messages in 
    natural text</li>
</ul>
<P>
      If actual communication takes place, an icon in the 
      <a href="Status%20bar.html">
         status bar</a> lights up for every message that is sent.</P>

   
<P> Note that the StageRace Messaging protocol is part of the StageRace product 
  and therefore falls under its <A HREF="../License.html" class="screenquote"> 
  License agreement</A>.</P>
<h2>Set Timing Idle</h2>
<p>The StageRace Server methods allow for arrival data to be submitted without 
  yet being processed. Processing can, this way, be postponed until <em>idle time</em>. 
  One dedicated method allows for flagging the start of idle time, so that pending 
  timing work can be processed, typically <a href="Generate.html">publications 
  generation</a>.</p>
<h2>Server Menu</h2>
<p>Through <span class="help_menu">Server</span> in the <span class="help_menu">Tools</span> 
  menu a few options are available for the StageRace Server:</p>
<ul>
  <li class="li_extensive"><span class="screenquote">Process pending timing work</span> 
    forces StageRace to process pending timing work. This will only be necessary 
    in very exceptional circumstances, e.g. when a consumer of the StageRace Server 
    got offline before it could flag the start of idle time.</li>
  <li class="li_extensive"><span class="screenquote">Send teams as</span> allows 
    to choose whether the textual representation of teams is sent as the team 
    code or the full team name.</li>
</ul>

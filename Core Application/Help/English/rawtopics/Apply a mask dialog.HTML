      Apply a Mask Dialog 
   </H1>

   <P>
      In order to quickly add a certain part of the competitors to a mask, a handy 
      function is added to the 
      <A HREF="Competitors%20view.html">
         Competitors view</A>, which allows for setting criteria to compare competitors 
      to.</P>

   
<P> The <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Apply a mask</SPAN> dialog can be opened from 
  within the <A HREF="Competitors%20view.html"> Competitors view</A> through <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">Apply 
  mask...</SPAN> in the <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">Edit</SPAN> menu. <A HREF="Masking.html"> 
  Masks must be configured</A> to have this function enabled in the menu.</P>
<P>With the <span class="screenquote">Apply a mask</span> dialog masks are also 
  be applied to <a href="Competitors%20and%20teams.html#sparecompetitors">spare 
  competitors</a>.</P>

      Set the Criteria 
   </H2>

   <P>
      A character string can be compared to the contents of one of the fields 
      of a competitor. Therefore you enter the character string and choose with 
      which field it has to be compared.</P>

   <P>
      The type of the comparison can be determined, from the following possibilities:</P>

   <UL>
         <LI> "<B CLASS="screenquote">&lt;=</B>": The value of the field must 
         be smaller or equal to the value of the character string;</LI><LI> "<B CLASS="screenquote">==</B>": 
         The value of the field must be entirely equal to the value of the character 
         string;</LI><LI> "<B CLASS="screenquote">=~</B>": The field must exists 
         in the character string or reverse; or</LI><LI> "<B CLASS="screenquote">&gt;=</B>": 
         The value of the field must be larger or equal to the value of the character 
         string.</LI>
   </UL>

   <P>
   </P>

   <P>
      The choice can be made to start with an empty mask, but also only to add 
      new competitors to the current mask.</P>

   <P>
      The involved mask can be chosen from the activated masks.</P>

   <H2>
      String Comparing 
   </H2>

   <P>
      The comparing of character strings takes place based on the order of the 
      ASCII standard. If you need more information, we suggest a web search for 
      &quot;extended ascii table&quot; or take your Windows<SUP>&reg;</SUP> Character 
      Map (<SPAN CLASS="screenquote">charmap.exe</SPAN>) as a reference.</P>

   <P>
      Start numbers will obviously be compared on numerical value.</P>

   <P>
      An asterisk can be used to ignore corresponding positions in character string 
      and field.</P>

   <H2>
      Example 
   </H2>

   <P>
      Let's apply a mask specifically for a youth classification, where competitors 
      born on or after March 15th 1988 compete in this youth classification.</P>

   <P>
      For this, make the following choices in the <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Apply 
      a mask</SPAN> dialog:</P>

   <UL>
      <LI><SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Field involved</SPAN>: &quot;UCI code&quot;;</LI><LI><SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Values</SPAN>: 
      &quot;&gt;=&quot; and &quot;***19880315&quot;;</LI><LI>Select the youth 
      classification 
      <A HREF="Masking.html">
         (that needs to be set up earlier)</A>; and then</LI><LI>Close the dialog 
      through <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">OK</SPAN>.</LI>
   </UL>

   <P>
      Note that the use as in this example is based on having the correct UCI 
      codes entered, in the country-year-month-day format like &quot;USA19740316&quot; 
      or &quot;NED19900120&quot;.</P>

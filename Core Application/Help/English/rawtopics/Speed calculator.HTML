      With this tool speed can be calculated quickly and easy from distance and 
      time.</P>

   <P>
      Pay attention that the times have to be entered from the left to the right 
      side. Thus first tens of hours, then hours, tens of minutes, minutes, etcetera. 
      The maximal accuracy is 1/1000th of a second, in accordance with StageRace.</P>

   <P>
      The distance has to be entered in meters.</P>

      <P>
         The result will always be given with a maximum accuracy of five digits 
         in total, either before or after the decimal comma.</P>

      <P>

         entered distance and the calculated speed in a miles based value.</P>

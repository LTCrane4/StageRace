<P> The default language of the StageRace program is English. However, when you 
  run StageRace in an environment with Dutch or French as the basic language, 
  StageRace will adapt to that.

      The Windows<SUP>®</SUP> default language can be changed in the <span class="screenquote">Regional 
      Settings</span> in the <span class="screenquote">Control Panel</span>. 

   <P>
      The future implementation of additional languages is being deliberated at 
      the time of writing.

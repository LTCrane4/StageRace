<P>Through the <span class="help_menu">View</span> menu coloring of the bars and

  <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Team properties</SPAN> dialog</A> is displayed.</P>
<P>Team properties can be edited <em>in-line</em>. Using the mouse pointer, clicking 
  once on a field of a single already selected team, the field can be edited. 
  This works for all the fields of a team. That way teams can be edited more quickly, 
  without going into the <a href="Team%20dialog.html"><span class="screenquote">Team 
  properties</span> dialog</a>.</P>

      Arrival Tab Sheet 
   </H1>

   <P>
      This tab sheet consists of two lists: <EM>available</EM> and <EM>classified</EM> 
      competitors. The list of available competitors consists of all competitors 
      who were not 
      <A HREF="Sign%20outs.html">
         signed out</A> nor dropped out at the start of the particular stage.</P>

      Submit 
   </H2>

   <P>
      Competitors can move from the <EM>available</EM> list to the <EM>classified</EM> 
      list by entering their start no. and ranking. When <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Submit</SPAN> 
      is clicked, the data is submitted and the competitor moves.</P>

   <P>
      When the tab sheet is used for a stage arrival, additionally the ridden 
      time can be entered. Then you can also select one or multiple competitors 
      in the <EM>classified</EM> list, change their time and click <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Submit</SPAN> 
      again to apply the entered time to the entire selection.</P>

   <H2>
      Declass. 
   </H2>

   
<P> When you select one or multiple competitors in the <EM>classified</EM> list, 
  and you click <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Declass.</SPAN>, the competitors are 
  moved back to the <EM>available</EM> list.</P>
<P>If set so in the <a href="Options.html">options</a> you can use the Del key 
  to declass. selected competitors from the <em>classified</em> list.</P>

   
<H2>Time Cut</H2>
<p>Competitors arriving after the <a href="Time%20cuts.html">finish deadline</a> 
  are indicated in red highlighting.</p>
<p>The <a href="Time%20cuts.html">finish deadline</a> can again be adjusted here, 
  because juryies often change the finish deadline on basis of what actually took 
  place during a half stage. The resulting <a href="Time%20cuts.html">time cuts</a> 
  are immediatelly updated in the <em>classified</em> list when you change the 
  deadline.</p>

   <P>
      A lot of attention is paid to this tab sheet, because it is going to be 
      used at the most critical moment of the entire event: the actual arrival. 
      Therefore: </P>

   <UL>
         <LI> As soon as a rider is classified, automatically the ranking field 
         will be incremented. So when you are entering successively ranked competitors, 
         you only need to enter the start nos. and possibly time (after the first 
         competitor has been entered);</LI><LI>When a rider is clicked in either 
         one of the two lists, its data will be copied into the edit boxes in 
         order to edit it quickly;</LI><LI>A large number of competitors can be 
         entered easily by one hand only, using the numeric area of the keyboard;</LI><LI>Pressing 
         the Enter key has the same result as clicking the <span class="screenquote">Submit</span> 
         button; and </LI><LI>Multiple riders from the <EM>classified</EM> list 
         can be selected (while holding down either the Shift or the Ctrl key). 
         All selected riders can be declassed momentarily. Also all selected riders 
         can be given a new time at the same moment. </LI>

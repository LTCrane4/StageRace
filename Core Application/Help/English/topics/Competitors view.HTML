      Selection

      You can select a competitor by single-clicking on it.</P>

      Multiple competitors can be selected in one of the following ways:</P>

   <UL>
      <LI>Click on the first competitor that must be selected, press the Shift

   <P>
      Through <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">Competitor/Team</SPAN> in the <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">Insert</SPAN> 
      menu a new competitor can be inserted into the competitors view. The 
      <A HREF="Competitor%20dialog.html">
         <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Edit competitor</SPAN> dialog</A> will appear,

      If <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">Repeatedly</SPAN> in the <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">Insert</SPAN>

   <P>
      Through <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">Delete</SPAN> in the <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">Edit</SPAN> 
      menu one or more selected competitors can be deleted. However, only competitors 
      can be deleted that are not used in an

   <P>
      Through <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">Edit selection...</SPAN> in the <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">Edit</SPAN>

      <A HREF="Competitor%20dialog.html">
         <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Edit competitor</SPAN> dialog</A> is displayed.</P>

   
<P>Competitor properties can be edited <em>in-line</em>. Using the mouse pointer, 
  clicking once on a field of a single already selected competitor, the field 
  can be edited. This works for all the fields of a competitor, except the team. 
  That way competitors can be edited more quickly, without going into the <a href="Competitor%20dialog.html"><span class="screenquote">Edit 
  competitor</span> dialog</a>. </P>

<P> <IMG src="../screenshots/screen46.gif" width="345" height="66" ALT="In-line editing of competitor no."></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Also the masks can be edited in-line: a pop-up menu will appear when you click 
  on a mask field of a single already selected competitor.</P>

      Clipboard

   <P>
      <A HREF="Clipboard.html">
         Cut, copy and paste competitors through the Windows<SUP>&reg;</SUP> clipboard</A>.</P>

   <P>
      Note that if the competitor nos. in the competitors view are grayed out, 
      this is a result of <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">Paste with start nos.</SPAN> 
      in the <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">Edit</SPAN> menu, which is also part of the 
      <A HREF="Clipboard.html#pastewithstartno">

   <P>
      When two competitors are selected, they can be swapped trough <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">Swap 
      competitors</SPAN> in the <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">Edit</SPAN> menu. Swapping 
      means that the two competitors exchange start nos. while keeping the rest 
      of their properties (name, team, etcetera).</P>

   <P>
      Swapping can be done between two active competitors, but also between an 
      active competitor and a 
      <A HREF="Competitors%20and%20teams.html#sparecompetitors">
         spare competitor</A>.</P>

   <P>
      This is a very handy function when last-minute a competitor needs replacing 
      by a 
      <A HREF="Competitors%20and%20teams.html#sparecompetitors">
         spare competitor</A>, or to shuffle competitors within a team during 
      registration of the team (or between teams if you would want to).</P>

   <H2>
      Masking 
   </H2>

   
<P> Automatically assign a number of competitors to one of the <A HREF="Masking.html"> 
  masks</A> using the <A HREF="Apply%20a%20mask%20dialog.html"> <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Apply 
  a mask</SPAN> dialog</A>.</P>
<h2>Cleanup Competitors</h2>
<P>Typos in competitor and team details can be corrected with the <a href="Cleanup%20competitors.html"><span class="screenquote">Cleanup 
  competitors</span> dialog</a>. </P>

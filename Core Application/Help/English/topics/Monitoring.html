<H1> Monitoring</H1>

   
<P>With monitoring the publication view can automatically reload when the (publication) 
  document has changed from the outside, thus not by the StageRace instance that 
  you are working from.</P>
<P>You can switch monitoring on and off through <span class="help_menu">Monitor 
  mode</span> in the <span class="help_menu">View</span> menu. Files that belong 
  to the currently opened event file will subsequently be monitored for outside 
  changes.</P>
<P>Through <span class="help_menu">Add file to monitor...</span> in the <span class="help_menu">View</span> 
  menu you can also add other files (HTML files, text files) for monitoring than 
  just those that are part of a StageRace event. They'll be opened in a <a href="MDI.html">new 
  window</a> within StageRace.</P>
<P>Monitoring is particularly suited for a work station running StageRace that 
  is only viewing things, e.g. for an on-site presenter or journalists.</P>

<P>The illustration above gives an overview of what could happen: one StageRace 
  instance regenerates a document, the second instance is monitoring the document 
  and refreshes it after regeneration by the first.</P>
<P>The involved files can be stored in some shared network folder, on which the 
  first StageRace instance may have full access rights and the second one just 
  has read access rights.</P>
<P>For performance reasons monitoring is not working on legacy Windows versions 
  9x and Me.</P>

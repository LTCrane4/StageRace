      Ranking Teams Classifications 
   </H1>

   <P>
      Here the test is described that is done when the team <EM>Subject</EM> is 
      compared to the team <EM>Test</EM>. This test is part of the 
      <A HREF="Classification%20rules.html">
         uniformed sorting process</A>.</P>

   <H2>
      Formal Description 
   </H2>

   <P>
   </P>

   <P>
      The test is described using a flow chart diagram. Flow charts are common 
      tools in engineering and are very appropriate to formally describe a sequence 
      of actions and conditions.</P>

   <P>
   </P>

   <P>
      The test basically answers the question &quot;insert here?&quot; and answers 
      it with a Yes or No (in the circles).</P>

   <P>
      Within the test, decisions are made (in the diamonds), either:</P>

   <UL>
      <LI>In blue: a decision directly based on 
      <A HREF="Settings%20ranking.html">
         ranking settings</A>; or</LI><LI>In black: a decision that compares properties 
      of <EM>Subject</EM> and <EM>Test</EM>.</LI>
   </UL>

      * indicates dependence on a

         ranking setting</A></P>

   <P>
      <EM>Latest</EM> or <EM>all</EM> always refers to only the half stages that

      Half Stage Teams Classification

   <P>
      The first diagram lays out that draws (ex equos) in half stage teams classifications 
      are resolved by looking at:</P>

   <UL>
      <LI>The sum of the rankings of the first <I>n*</I> competitors of the team 
      (the bunch) that finished in the half stage*; and</LI><LI>The placing of 
      the deciding competitor*.</LI>
   </UL>

      <a href="UCI%20compliance.html">
         <span class="help_uci">(2.3.044 and 2.6.016)</span></a></p>

   <P>
      The initial sort order is the sum of the times of the first <I>n</I>* competitors 
      of the team (the bunch) that finished in the half stage.</P>

   <P>
   </P>

   <H3>
      General Teams Classification 
   </H3>

   <P>
      The second diagram lays out that draws (ex equos) in general teams classifications 
      are resolved by looking at:</P>

   <UL>
      <LI>The sum of the rankings in all team half stage classifications*;</LI><LI>The 
      latest team half stage classification's ranking*; and</LI><LI>The latest 
      general classification result of the best competitor of the team.</LI>
   </UL>

   <P>
      <a href="UCI%20compliance.html">
         <span class="help_uci">(2.6.016)</span></a></P>

   <p>
   </p>

   <P>
      The initial sort order is the sum of the team's times in all half stage 
      teams classifications.</P>

   <P>
      Every 
      <A HREF="Half%20stages.html">
         half stage</A> can be a time trial.</P>

   <P>
      Time trials are treated distinctly different than regular 
      <A HREF="Half%20stages.html">
         half stages</A>. The differences are:</P>

   
<UL>
  <LI> For a time trial a starting order and starting times have to be entered 
    in the <A HREF="Time%20trial%20starting%20order%20dialog.html"> <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Time 
    trial starting order</SPAN> dialog</A>;</LI>
  <LI>Competitors get their ranking automatically based on the time that they 
    ride, rather than the actual ranking being entered;</LI>
  <LI>Optionally, gross times can be entered which are automatically calculated 
    into net times, based on the starting time; and</LI>
  <LI>For time trials on gross time an arrival list is generated, that shows the 
    stage results sorted on the moment of arrival of each competitor (specifically 
    targetted at an on-site presenter or journalists).</LI>
</UL>

   <P>
      A 
      <A HREF="Half%20stages.html">
         half stage</A> can be set to be a time trial by use of the tab sheet 
      <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Half stage settings</SPAN> of the 
      <A HREF="Half%20stages.html">
         configuration of the particular half stage</A>. This can be found through 
      <SPAN CLASS="help_menu"> Configure selection...</SPAN> in the <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">Configuration</SPAN> 
      menu, when the appropriate 
      <A HREF="Half%20stages.html">
         half stage</A> is selected in the 
      <A HREF="Event%20tree.html">
         event tree</A>.</P>

<P> <IMG src="../screenshots/screen11.gif" width="328" height="173" ALT="Setting a time trial using the Half stage settings dialog"></P>

   
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Here you can also choose if it is allowed for the time trial <a href="Time%20trials.html"></a> 
  to make changes to the <a href="Time%20trial%20starting%20order%20dialog.html">starting 
  order</a> even when already competitors have been ranked.</P>

      Time Trial 
   </H3>

   <P>
      When you set a 
      <A HREF="Half%20stages.html">
         half stage</A> to be a time trial, the number of rounds is automatically 
      set to <EM>one</EM>, and the net or gross time selection becomes available. 
      After confirmation the 
      <A HREF="Event%20tree.html">
         event tree</A> is updated, displaying the time trial and the <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Starting 
      order</SPAN> within.</P>

   <H3>
      Net or Gross 
   </H3>

   <P>
      There are two modes for time trials:</P>

   <UL>
      <LI CLASS="li_extensive"><EM><SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Input gross times</SPAN></EM><SPAN CLASS="li_extensive"><BR>The 
      arrival time that is entered is the time between the start of the <EM>first</EM> 
      competitor and the finish of the concerning competitor. StageRace will take 
      the entered time and subtract from this the start time of the concerning 
      competitor. For this the starting order of the time trial is used.</SPAN></LI><LI CLASS="li_extensive"><EM><SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Input 
      net times</SPAN></EM><BR>The arrival time that is entered is exactly the 
      time that it took that competitor to finish the race. The 
      <A HREF="Time%20trial%20starting%20order%20dialog.html">
         starting order</A> of the time trial is only used informatively.</LI>

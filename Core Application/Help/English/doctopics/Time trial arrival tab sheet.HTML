      Time Trial Arrival Tab Sheet 
   </H4>

   <P>
      This tab sheet consists of two lists: <EM>available</EM> and <EM>classified</EM> 
      competitors. The list of available competitors consists of all competitors 
      who were not 
      
         signed out at the start of the particular time trial and that are 
      entered in the 
      
         starting order for the time trial.</P>

   <P>
      Competitors can move from the <EM>available</EM> list to the <EM>classified</EM> 
      list by entering their start no. and time. When <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Submit</SPAN> 
      is clicked, the data is submitted and the competitor moves. Competitors 
      are automatically ranked, based on the times that you enter. Depending on 
      the 
      
         time trial settings, the time you enter is used directly (net times 
      mode) or the 
      
         start time is subtracted first from the 
      
         start time (gross times mode).</P>

   <P>
      You can also select one or multiple competitors in the <EM>classified</EM> 
      list, change their time and click <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Submit</SPAN> 
      again to apply the entered time to the entire selection.</P>

   <P>
      Note that (no matter what 
      
         anticipated time setting you make) the gross time that you enter 
      for a competitor must be more than the starting time that is going to be 
      subtracted from the entered gross arrival time, in gross times mode. If 
      not, the resulting time is unpredictable.</P>

   <H5>
      Declass. 
   </H5>

   <P>
      When you select one or multiple competitors in the <EM>classified</EM> list, 
      and you click <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Declass.</SPAN>, the competitors 
      are moved back to the <EM>available</EM> list.</P>

      Functions

   <P>
      A lot of attention is paid to this tab sheet, because it is going to be 
      used at the most critical moment of the time trial: the actual arrival. 
      Therefore: </P>

   <UL>
      <LI>When a rider is clicked in either one of the two lists, its data will 
      be copied into the edit boxes in order to edit it quickly;</LI><LI>A large 
      number of competitors can be entered easily by one hand only, using the 
      numeric area of the keyboard;</LI><LI>Pressing the Enter key has the same 
      result as clicking the <span class="screenquote">Submit</span> button;</LI><LI>Multiple 
      riders from the <EM>classified</EM> list can be selected (while holding 
      down either the Shift or the Ctrl key). All selected riders can be declassed 
      momentarely. Also all selected riders can be given a new time at the same 
      moment; and</LI><LI><SPAN CLASS="li_extensive">Select all competitors at 
      once in the <EM>classified</EM> list by pressing the Ctrl+A key combination.</SPAN></LI>
   </UL>

   <P>

   <P>
      Note that rankings are always recalculated whatever you change in the this 
      tab sheet, so that you always see the latest time trial ranking!</P>

   <h5>
      
      Anticipate Time
   </h5>

   <p>
      This function is only enabled for time trials on gross times.</p>

      <p>
         You can inform the time trial arrival tab sheet about the approximate 
         time that is expected for arrivals during this half stage. This is specifically 
         done to compensate for clocks that are often used in timing that only 
         display minutes and seconds and will overflow after each hour. If you 
         enter the anticipated time that you expect, you can just enter an arrival 
         time in the 0-60 minutes interval and StageRace will add <em>full hours</em> 
         (or subtract them if you would enter a very large time value) until the 
         time is close to the set anticipated time.</p>

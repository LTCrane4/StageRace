<H1> Most Aggressive Rider Classifications </H1>

   
<P> For every  half stage you can set up a scheme 
  of points for the most aggressive rider classification.</P>
<p> The most aggressive riders classification has little to do with stage classifications, 
  but are simply determined by e.g. jury members or team captains.</p>
<p> For most aggressive rider classifications a separate publication is generated, 
  which lists the competitors and their points from the particular  
  half stage as well as the general most aggressive rider classification. 
</p>
<p>The most general aggressive rider classifications is calculated in the same 
  way as the sprint classification. 
  The same ranking settings also apply.</p>
<h2> Configuration </h2>
<p> The configuration of most aggressive rider points will be done by use of the 
  tab sheet <span class="screenquote">Most aggressive rider</span> of the  
  configuration of the particular half stage. This can be found through <span class="help_menu"> 
  Configure selection...</span> in the <span class="help_menu">Configuration</span> 
  menu, when the appropriate  half stage is selected 
  in the  event tree.</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p> <img src="../screenshots/screen89.gif" width="422" height="411" alt="Configuration of a most aggressive rider classification"></p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p> On the tab sheet there is a list <span class="screenquote">Points</span> to 
  enter the points for the half stage's most aggressive rider classification. 
  The points in this list correspond to the successive rankings, starting from 
  1.</p>
<h3> Add </h3>
<p> To add points, the number of points has to be entered in the field above the 
  list and <span class="screenquote">Add</span> has to be clicked.</p>
<p> There is no real limit to the amount of points entries that you can enter.</p>
<h3> Remove </h3>
<p> If a points entry is selected from the list, it can be deleted by clicking 
  <span class="screenquote">Remove</span>.</p>
<p> By entering no points entries at all, the <span class="screenquote">Most aggressive 
  rider competition</span> item will subsequently be removed from the  
  event tree.</p>

      Ranking Sprint Classifications 
   </H2>

   <P>
      Here the test is described that is done when the competitor <EM>Subject</EM> 
      is compared to the competitor <EM>Test</EM>. This test is part of the 
      
         uniformed sorting process.</P>

   <H3>
      Formal Description 
   </H3>

   <P>
      The test is described using a flow chart diagram. Flow charts are common 
      tools in engineering and are very appropriate to formally describe a sequence 
      of actions and conditions.</P>

   <P>
      The test basically answers the question &quot;insert here?&quot; and answers 
      it with a Yes or No (in the circles).</P>

   <P>
      Within the test, decisions are made (in the diamonds), either:</P>

   <UL>
      <LI>In blue: a decision directly based on 
      
         ranking settings; or</LI><LI>In black: a decision that compares properties 
      of <EM>Subject</EM> and <EM>Test</EM>.</LI>
   </UL>

   <p>
      The constant values CALCDEPTH_STAGE and CALCDEPTH_INTERM can be set in the 
      
         ranking settings. They signify the rank up to which <em>Test</em> 
      and <em>Subject</em> are compared for &quot;Most high rankings&quot; in 
      respectively stage arrivals and intermediate sprints.</p>

   <H3>
      Informal Description 
   </H3>

   <P>
      The diagram lays out that draws (ex equos) in sprint classifications are 
      resolved by looking at:</P>

   <UL>
      <LI>The most high rankings in half stages*;</LI><LI>The most high rankings 
      in intermediate sprints*;</LI><LI>The latest half stage ranking or* the 
      latest general classification; and</LI><LI>The latest intermediate sprint.</LI>
   </UL>

   <P>
      The initial sort order is the sum of the points from all sprints. </P>

   <P>
      * indicates dependence on a 
      
         ranking setting</P>

   <P>
      <EM>Latest</EM> or <EM>all</EM> always refers to only the half stages that 
      have come by, up to and including the half stage for which the sorting is 
      currently done.</P>

   <P>
      <EM>Most high rankings</EM> means comparing the number of first place rankings. 
      If still a draw exists, comparing the number of second place rankings. Then 
      third place rankings. Etcetera.</P>

   <h3>
      Unofficial Classification
   </h3>

   <p>
      Competitors must finish in order to appear in the sprint classification 
      of that stage. When the sprint classification is generated before the end 
      of a stage (thus when no competitors at all have finished yet) the statement 
      &quot;unofficial classification&quot; is printed on the classification.</p>

   <p>
      As soon as competitors start finishing, StageRace only includes those competitors 
      in the general sprint classification which also still exist in the general 
      individual classification.</p>

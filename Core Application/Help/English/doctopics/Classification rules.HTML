      Classification Rules (Sorting Process) 
   </H2>

   <P>
      To describe how rules can be applied for a certain 
      
         derived classification, a part of the sorting process is described 
      in a uniformed way. Details are different for each 
      
         derived classification. The basics are explained here once.</P>

   <P>
      When sorting competitors, the competitor that needs placing (<EM>Subject</EM>) 
      is taken and compared to the competitors that are already in the list. Every 
      existing competitor in the list is taken, starting with the first, working 
      down in the list. Every competitor that is taken is referred to as <EM>Test</EM>, 
      and compared to <EM>Subject</EM>.</P>

   <P>
      The test that is done basically comes down to asking &quot;insert here?&quot; 
      with <EM>Subject</EM> and <EM>Test</EM> as parameters. Such test could be 
      &quot;is time <EM>Test</EM> &gt; time <EM>Subject</EM>?&quot;. If the result 
      of the test is positive, <EM>Subject</EM> is inserted before <EM>Test</EM>, 
      as illustrated in the schematic just before. Unfortunately, in practice 
      the tests are more complicated than that.</P>

   <P>
      The tests are different for each 
      
         derived classification and are described in connection to the respective 
      
         derived classification:</P>

   <UL>
      <LI> 
      
         General individual classification on time and all masked variations</LI><LI> 
      
         General individual classification on points</LI><LI> 
      
         General individual sprint classification (on points)</LI><LI> 
      
         General individual climbing classification (on points)</LI><LI> 
      
         Half stage teams classification on time</LI><LI> 
      
         General teams classification on time</LI>
   </UL>

   <P>
      You can set which rules must be applied for calculating derived classifications, 
      through the 
      
         ranking settings.</P>

<p> Team codes in the HTML documents appear by default as hyperlinks to the specific 
  teams in the <span class="screenquote">Competitors list per team</span>. For 
  this you may want to guarantee that this <span class="screenquote">Competitors 
  list per team</span> publication exists on your web server when you upload classifications. 
  These hyperlinks can be switched off in the HTML 
  settings.</p>
<p>For team classifications it is possible to select if and how the involved bunch 
  of competitors is included:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Don't include the involved bunch of competitors;</li>
  <li>Include competitor numbers of the involved bunch of competitors, all on 
    a single line;</li>
  <li>Include competitor numbers of the involved bunch of competitors, each on 
    a new line; or</li>
  <li>Include extensive competitor information of the involved bunch of competitors, 
    each on a new line. The competitor details are given as configured for the 
    <span class="screenquote">Columns selection for individual classifications</span> 
    in the publication settings. </li>

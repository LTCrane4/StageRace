      Ranking General Classifications 
   </H2>

   <P>
      Here the test is described that is done when the competitor <EM>Subject</EM> 
      is compared to the competitor <EM>Test</EM>. This test is part of the 
      
         uniformed sorting process.</P>

   <H3>
      Formal Description 
   </H3>

   <P>
      The test is described using a flow chart diagram. Flow charts are common 
      tools in engineering and are very appropriate to formally describe a sequence 
      of actions and conditions.</P>

   <P>
   </P>

   <P>
      The test basically answers the question &quot;insert here?&quot; and answers 
      it with a Yes or No (in the circles).</P>

   <P>
      Within the test, decisions are made (in the diamonds), either:</P>

   <UL>
      <LI>In blue: a decision directly based on 
      
         ranking settings; or</LI><LI>In black: a decision that compares properties 
      of <EM>Subject</EM> and <EM>Test</EM>.</LI>
   </UL>

      Informal Description 
   </H3>

   <P>
   </P>

   <P>
      The diagram lays out that draws (ex equos) in general individual classifications 
      are resolved by looking at:</P>

   <UL>
      <LI>The sum of the tenths/hundredths/thousandths of seconds from all time 
      trials*;</LI><LI>The sum of the rankings in all half stages*; and</LI><LI>The 
      latest half stage ranking.</LI>
   </UL>

   <P>
      
         <span class="help_uci">(2.6.016 bis)</span></P>

   <p>
   </p>

   <P>
      The initial sort order is the sum of the times in all half stage classifications. 
   </P>

   <P>
   </P>

   <P>
      * indicates dependence on a 
      
         ranking setting</P>

   <P>
      <EM>Latest</EM> or <EM>all</EM> always refers to only the half stages that 
      have come by, up to and including the half stage for which the sorting is 
      currently done.</P>

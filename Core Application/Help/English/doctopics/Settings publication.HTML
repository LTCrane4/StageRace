<P>The following publication settings can be made. These settings are among the 
  most powerful that are available in StageRace.</P>
<h5>Communique Numbering</h5>
<P>You can enable the  communiqu&eacute; 
  numbering system.</P>
<h5>Header</h5>
<p>You can fully configure the contents of the publication 
  header:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Choose to print a recognition string in the top left corner of publications, 
    and if it must be repeated on subsequent pages;</li>
  <li>Choose to print the event title and subtitle and set its alignment;</li>
  <li>Choose the alignment of the event logo;</li>
  <li>Choose whether subtitles must be replaced or accompanied by the appropriate 
    classification sponsors or that the sponsors must not be printed at all; and</li>
  <li>Select the property labels that are printed at the top of publications and 
    if labels and values are printed side-by-side or under each other.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Body</h5>
<p> You can fully configure the columns for publications.</p>
<p>Note that here you can set the printing of higher accuracy that is used for 
  time trials to be applied only when it involves two consecutive competitors 
  having a draw in the full seconds time  <span class="help_uci">(2.4.016, 
  2.5.012)</span> or even switch off higher accuracy times altogether, no 
  matter it being a time trial.</p>
<p>Note that you can have competitors lists on teams be printed in a number of 
  columns, selected between one and six.</p>
<p>You can set the token that is used as indicator instead of gap times that are 
  equal to the previous ones in  <span class="screenquote"> 
  Gap for new time only</span> columns.</p>
<h5>Footer</h5>
<p>You can fully configure the publication 
  footer:</p>
<ul>

    deadline in table form;</li>
  <li>Enable printing of dropped out competitors on stage classifications in table 
    form;</li>
  <li>Enable printing of sign outs on stage classifications;</li>
  <li>Enable printing of statistic information: general statistics, competitors 
    after the finish deadline and dropped out competitors 
    in compact form;</li>
  <li>Enable and configure printing of the signature; and </li>
  <li>Enable printing of a time stamp, with optional time zone information, and 
    give its accuracy.</li>
</ul>

  signature. The entered signature can be name plus title of the chairman 
  of the jury, for instance.</p>
<h5>Languages</h5>
<p>You can select the  languages that 
  are used on publications. Available languages are shown, and can be added, already 
  previously added languages can be removed.</p>
<h5>Cross Out Lists</h5>
<p>The way cross out lists look can be 
  chosen. You can choose to include team names, competitor names or both. For 
  when team names are included, the amount of competitors on each row of the  
  cross out list can be set.</p>
<h5>Mask Indicators</h5>
<p>You can enter the tokens that are used as indicator for a  
  mask on the competitor lists.</p>
<p>For instance: <span class="screenquote">#</span> or <span class="screenquote">U21</span>, 
  but HTML text like <span class="screenquote">&lt;IMG SRC=&quot;logo.gif&quot; 
  WIDTH=&quot;21&quot;&gt;</span> is also allowed.</p>
<p>The choices made here only apply if the particular mask is activated in the 
   general settings.</p>
<p>This can only be entered for masks 1, 2 and 3. The other masks will automatically 
  be indicated as M4, M5, et cetera.</p>
<h5>Miscellaneous</h5>
<p>You can choose to use <em>kilometres</em>, <em>miles</em> or both. This also 
  affects speeds. Note that this setting only applies to publications, not to 
  exported files.</p>

  in normal or reverse order, and where to print the references to competitors 
  lists (top or bottom).</p>

<p>You can enable your own advertisement information at the bottom of each publication, 
  rather than just a short StageRace one-liner, and choose if and how there is 
  a hyperlink included, and enter the text for the advertisement. You can enter 
  the name and one extra informative line about the party that is in charge of 
  the classification service for the event.</p>
<p>This information will be printed as advertising at the  
  bottom of all publications.</p>

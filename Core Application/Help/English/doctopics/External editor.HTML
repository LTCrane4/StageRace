      External Editor 
   </H2>

   <P>
      Through <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">Edit publication externally</SPAN> in the 
      <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">Tools</SPAN> menu, you can launch the editor of 
      
         your choice for editing the publication for which the 
      
         event tree item is currently selected. You can choose the desired 
      editor through <SPAN CLASS="help_menu"> 
      
         Options</SPAN> in the <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">Tools</SPAN> menu. 
      By default the editor is set to the Microsoft<SUP>&reg;</SUP> Notepad.</P>

   <P>
      You might want to use this function if your event uses very particular and 
      unusual rules for which StageRace cannot cater, or when publications need 
      editing otherwise.</P>

   <P>
      After you manually change a publication, you have to refresh the 
      
         publication view through <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">Refresh</SPAN> in 
      the <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">View</SPAN> menu. Also, you may want to set 
      the particular publication to 
      
         read-only (through <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">Read-only publication</SPAN> 
      in the <SPAN CLASS="help_menu"> 
      
         Generate</SPAN> menu) to prevent your manual changes to be overwritten 
      by StageRace.</P>

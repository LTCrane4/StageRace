      Corrections 
   </H4>

   <P>
      After the actual ranking of a half stage, some corrections 
      
       might be necessary, based on jury decisions.</P>

   <P>
      Corrections are entered as times and for individual competitors.</P>

   <P>
      Corrections are entered in the 
      
         <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Corrections</SPAN> tab sheet in the 
      
         <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Arrival</SPAN> dialog. </P>

      Bonuses 
   </H5>

   <P>
      A correction bonus may be used to cater for event-specific rules that are 
      not in compliance with the rules that StageRace can apply, of which the 
      
         UCI regulations are just a part.</P>

   <P>
      Correction bonus seconds count towards the general individual classification 
      and to the general individual 
      
         masked classifications. Correction bonus seconds that are entered, 
      are usually listed between normal 
      
         bonuses on stage classifications; this depending on 
      
         publication settings.</P>

   <P>
      If your event is in full compliance with the regulations as StageRace handles 
      them, you should never have to use correction bonuses.</P>

   <H5>
      Penalties 
   </H5>

   <P>
      A correction penalty may be used to penalize competitors for foul play.</P>

   <P>
      Correction penalty seconds count towards the general individual classification 
      and to the general individual 
      
         masked classifications. Correction penalty seconds that are entered, 
      are usually listed in a separate column, adjacent to the 
      
         bonuses on stage classifications; this depending on 
      
         publication settings.</P>

   <P>
      The assignment of correction penalties is always the result of a decision 
      of the jury, to cater for disciplinary measures.</P>

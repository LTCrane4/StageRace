<H1> Profile Picker</H1>

   
<p> Profiles are a very powerful feature of StageRace, 
  however, they are very easily maintainable through the <span class="screenquote">Profile 
  picker</span> dialog that you can find through <span class="help_menu">Profile 
  picker...</span> in the <span class="help_menu">Configure</span> menu.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="../screenshots/screen2.gif" width="429" height="405" alt="Profile picker"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The picker allows to set the current profile, by selecting the desired profile 
  in the list and choosing <span class="screenquote">Set current</span> button. 
  Subsequently the currently set profile is indicated by the postfix &quot;<span class="screenquote">(Current 
  profile)</span>&quot;.</p>
<p>Through this dialog also new profiles can be added and a selected profile can 
  be renamed or removed. The first, original profile that was part of this event 
  (initially called &quot;<span class="screenquote">Main profile</span>&quot;) 
  can never be removed, because it holds the shared general 
  settings, ranking settings and access 
  settings for all profiles.</p>
<p>When adding or renaming a profile, the profile name can be changed in the <span class="screenquote">Profile 
  name</span> dialog. In this dialog are also the settings shown that are explicitly 
  kept for that profile.</p>
<p>Use the check boxes at the bottom of the dialog to set how publication 
  file names are affected by profiles:</p>
<ul>
  <li><span class="screenquote">Adjust publication file names to profile</span>: 
    make different publication file, rather than overwriting the same files, no 
    matter what profile they're for; and</li>
  <li><span class="screenquote">Use profile name for file names</span>: use the 
    name of the profile for its publications, rather than ordinal numbers, e.g. 
    &quot;<span class="screenquote">profile #1</span>&quot;.</li>
</ul>

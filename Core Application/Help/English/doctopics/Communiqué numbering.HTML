      Communiqu&eacute; Numbering 
   </H2>

   <P>
      Communiqu&eacute; numbering is the process of assigning ordinal numbers 
      to all publications of an event, as required by the UCI 
      
         <span class="help_uci">(2.2.090 and 2.2.091)</span>.</P>

   <H3>
      Activation 
   </H3>

   <P>
      Communiqu&eacute; numbering must be switched on in the 
      
         <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Publication</SPAN> section of the settings 
         dialog.</P>

   <H3>
      Publishing 
   </H3>

   <P>
      Publications can be published in two steps:</P>

   <OL> <LI CLASS="li_extensive"><EM>Assign communiqu&eacute; number</EM><BR> 
   A number can be assigned to a document by stepping towards the desired number 
   using Decrement publication no. or Increment publication no. in the Edit menu. 
   The current number for a publication is shown in a bar (read below) at the 
   top of the 
   
      event tree. Numbers that are already in use with published communiqu&eacute;s, 
   will be skipped.</LI><LI CLASS="li_extensive"><EM>Publish</EM><BR> A publication 
   can effectively be published by checking the appropriate check boxes in the 
   
      event tree using Publish in the Edit menu. A communiqu&eacute; number 
   has to be assigned before publication can be checked, as explained above. The 
   chosen communiqu&eacute; number may not be in use already for the publishing 
   to work.</LI></OL>
   <p>
      Note the distinct difference between publishing and generating.</p>

   <H3>
      Generating 
   </H3>

   <P>
      If a document is not yet effectively published as described above, the communiqu&eacute; 
      number will be omitted entirely during generating.</P>

   <P>
      On published documents, the communiqu&eacute; number will be printed, the 
      next time it is generated.</P>

   <P>
      The 
      
         table of contents for an event will also display the communiqu&eacute; 
      numbers. When communiqu&eacute; numbering is activated, the 
      
         table of contents will only list those publications that are actually 
      effectively published, so that you can let an online 
      
         table of contents grow during the event.</P>

   <H3>
      Communiqu&eacute; Number Bar 
   </H3>

   <P>
      The communiqu&eacute; number bar is displayed at the top of the 
      
         event tree.</P>

   <P>&nbsp;
   </P>

   
<P> <IMG src="../screenshots/screen82.gif" width="338" height="298" ALT="Communiqu&eacute; number bar"><P CLASS="caption">Communiqu&eacute; number bar</P></P>

   <P>&nbsp;
   </P>

   <P>
      It shows the number that is currently assigned to a publication.</P>

   <P>
      The color used for displaying the number is indicative for the usage of 
      the number's value; namely:</P>

   <UL>
      <LI><EM>Red</EM>: the number is in use by this publication that is actually 
      effectively published (as in the picture above);</LI><LI><EM>Yellow</EM>: 
      the number is in use by another publication; and</LI><LI><EM>Green</EM>: 
      the number is available for this publication, but it is not yet published.</LI>
   </UL>

   
<p> When communiqu&eacute; numbering is switched off, the communiqu&eacute; number 
  bar is hidden.</p>
<h3>Auto-Number Communiqu&eacute;s</h3>
<p>Use the <span class="screenquote">Auto-number communiqu&eacute;s</span> dialog 
  to automatically number all the communiqu&eacute;s that are not currently published. 
  You can find the <span class="screenquote">Auto-number communiqu&eacute;s</span> 
  dialog through <span class="help_menu">Auto-Number Communiqu&eacute;s...</span> 
  in the <span class="help_menu">Edit</span> menu.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="../screenshots/screen1.gif" width="489" height="237" alt="Auto-number communiqu&eacute;s"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the <span class="screenquote">Auto-number communiqu&eacute;s</span> dialog 
  you can choose if you want to include certain types of publications that are 
  not always required to have communiqu&eacute; numbers, namely: cross out lists, 
  sign in lists, general classifications sorted on start no.</p>

            automatically?</SPAN> The way as it is, it is possible to insert external 
            publications. For instance very exceptional classifications or informative 
            race reports can be foreseen with a communiqu&eacute; number that 
            nevertheless fits into StageRace's communiqu&eacute; numbering nicely.

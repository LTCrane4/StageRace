         Stage Race Organization 
      </H3>

   <P>
      The following is how stage race events are configured in StageRace.</P>

   <P>
      An event consists of a number of 
      
         full stages or days.</P>

   <P>
      Every full stage consists of one or several 
      
         half stages. This means that also for a day on which only one stage 
      takes place, a full stage with only one half stage within must be constructed. 
      Besides regular half stages, a half stage can also be a 
      
         time trial.</P>

   
<P> For every single half stage you can configure the desired scheme for  
  bonus seconds that counts towards the general classification and the desired 
  points schemes for  sprint,  
  points,  climbing and most 
  aggressive rider classifications.</P>

   <P>
      Also you make the overall 
      
         settings for the event.</P>

   <P>&nbsp;
   </P>

   <P>
      Note that anything you change to the configuration of an event is not processed 
      into the publications until they are 
      
         regenerated. This in contrast to when entering data during the race.</P>

      Alge OPTIc is a computerized color photo finish system with integrated processing 
      software. The Color Line Scan Camera scans every movement on the finish

      Importing 
   </H4>

   <P>
      Classifications made in OPTIc are available automatically in tab separated 
      text format.</P>

   <P>
      This data can be found in a <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">.txt</SPAN> file of 
      which the name is equal to the one of the race (<SPAN CLASS="screenquote">.rac</SPAN>) 
      that is the subject.</P>

   <P>
      Within StageRace, the 
      
         <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Arrival</SPAN> tab provides file import. 
      In the <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Import classification</SPAN> file dialog 
      the text file that contains the classification data can be picked. Additionally, 
      the file type in this dialog should be set to <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Alge 
      OPTIc Results</SPAN> so that StageRace bypasses the advanced 
      
         <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Control import classification</SPAN> dialog 
      and directly imports the OPTIc data.</P>

   <P>
      For OPTIc operation, please refer to the appropriate documentation.</P>

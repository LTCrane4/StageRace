      StageRace is a full-blown administration program for road cycling stage 
      races.

   <P>
      A big problem at road cycling stage races is generating the rankings or 
      classifications. It sometimes even gets really messy. Now put that all behind 
      you, using StageRace. It works accurately and fast, and is unique in its 
      completeness and performance.</P>

   <P>
      You input the raw data; StageRace calculates all 
      
         your classifications accordingly.</P>

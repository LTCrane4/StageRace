   <P>
      The number of 
      
         competitors, spare competitors and teams is also displayed in the 
      event tree at the respective items, <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Competitors</SPAN> 
      and <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Teams</SPAN>.<BR> </P>

   <H3>
      Navigation 
   </H3>

   <P>
      Every item in the event tree can be selected by: 

   <UL>
      <LI>Single-clicking on the item, using the left mouse button; or</LI><LI>Walking 
      to the item, using the arrow keys on your keyboard.</LI>
   </UL>

   <P>
      Note that keyboard users might need to 
      
         switch views first to give focus to the event tree. 

   <P>
   </P>

   <P>
      A tree item can be expanded by: 

   <UL>
      <LI> Single-clicking on the &quot;+&quot; icon in front of the item, using 
      the left mouse button; or</LI><LI>Pressing the right arrow key on your keyboard 
      once the item is selected.</LI>
   </UL>

   <P>
      Note that all tree items can be expanded at once through <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">Expand 
      all tree items</SPAN> in the <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">View</SPAN> menu.</P>

   <H3>
      Selection 
   </H3>

   <P>
      Depending on the type of item you select in the tree: 

   <UL>
      <LI>An appropriate 
      
         work view is displayed in the right pane of the work space; and/or 
      </LI><BLOCKQUOTE> 
      <P>
         Often the appropriate work view for an item will be the 
         
            publication view, displaying the publication that is associated 
         with the selected event item. Note that the root item has the 
         
            table of contents associated with it. </P>

      </BLOCKQUOTE><LI>An appropriate dialog window can be opened, such as the 
      
         communiqu&eacute; editor, the 
      
         arrival dialog and the 
      
         sign outs dialog. <BLOCKQUOTE> 
      <P>
         These dialog windows can be opened through <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">Edit 
         selection...</SPAN> in the <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">Edit</SPAN> menu or 
         by double-clicking on the selected item.</P>

      </BLOCKQUOTE></LI>
   </UL>

   <H3>
      Communiqu&eacute; Numbering 
   </H3>

   <P>
      When 
      
         communiqu&eacute; numbering is selected in the 
      
         general settings, all tree items that have publications associated 
      with them are equipped with check boxes to publish these publications. 

   <P>&nbsp;

   
<P> <IMG src="../screenshots/screen37.gif" width="180" height="307" ALT="Check boxes for communiqu&eacute; numbering (publishing)"><P CLASS="caption">Check boxes for communiqu&eacute; numbering (publishing)</P>

   <H3>
      Hiding the Tree 
   </H3>

   <P>
      Through <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">Event tree</SPAN> in the <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">View</SPAN> 
      menu the event tree can be hidden.</P>

   <P>
      In the same way a hidden event tree can be shown again.</P>

   <P>&nbsp;
   </P>

   
<P> <IMG src="../screenshots/screen21.gif" width="198" height="150" ALT="Event tree shown"><P CLASS="caption">Event tree shown</P>&nbsp; 
  <IMG src="../screenshots/screen26.gif" width="198" height="150" ALT="Event tree hidden"><P CLASS="caption">Event tree hidden</P></P>

   
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>You can also hide the tree by double clicking on the edge that separates the 
  tree from the work view on the right. Similarly 
  you can have the tree shown again by double clicking on the very left edge of 
  the document window.</P>

   
<P> Note that the event tree cannot be hidden when the right pane is displaying 
  the  blank work view, because doing so would 
  not make any sense.</P>

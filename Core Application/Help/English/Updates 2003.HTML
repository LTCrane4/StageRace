internal beta builds lead to this V2.00 beta release:</p><ul> <li>Build 451: June 
16th 2002</li><li>Build 1136: July 24th 2002</li><li>Build 1737: October 2nd 2002</li><li>Build 
1770: October 4th 2002</li><li>Build 1772: October 5th 2002</li><li>Build 1987: 
October 17th 2002</li><li>Build 1994: October 23rd 2002</li><li>Build 2314: November 
7th 2002</li><li>Build 2341: November 18th 2002</li><li>Build 2366: November 26th 
2002</li><li>Build 2733: December 31st 2002</li></ul><h3> Added Main Features 
</h3><ol> <li>Points classifications (in addition to sprint classifications) can 
now be handled (see stage settings and the generated results). Note that so far 
the classification generator from the sprint classifications is used for this 
type of classification, which might need some adaption &lt;451&gt;</li><li>Functionality 
is added to allow for individual incidental bonuses and penalties ('corrections') 
to be assigned to competitors. Herefor the file type is adapted, a tab is added 
to the Arrival dialogs, the appropriate columns are being added now to the stage 
classifications (only if required) and these corrections are taken into account 
with the general classification &lt;451&gt;</li><li>Through General Settings the 
first half stage now can be indicated to be a prologue. This way the first half 
stage of your event will not be counted towards the overall distance and have 
no stage no. &lt;1737&gt;</li><li>Settings dialog and underlying data structure 
have been dramatically redesigned; additionally the main properties have been 
removed from the main items tree &lt;1136&gt;</li><li>Arrival dialog functions 
for half stages can now also be accessed through the main items tree and the Edit 
menu, so that for import based classifications use of the Arrival dialog is not 
always necessary anymore &lt;1770&gt; </li><li>Through the half stage configuration 
dialog time trials can now be chosen to be based on either net times (where starting 
times only exist for informational purposes) or gross times (as was the standard 
way of conducting time trials in StageRace so far). Arrival dialogs have been 
adjusted accordingly &lt;1987&gt;</li><li>In the edit window for communiqués now 
an additional preview window can be opened, immediately displaying the communiqué's 
body text &lt;1737&gt;</li><li>Support for .str work folder implemented with a 
button in File Open/Save dialog. The folder can be set in the Options dialog &lt;1987&gt; 
</li><li>Drag and drop support has been implemented in the main items tree for 
supporting the event items selection dialog, discussed elsewhere &lt;1136&gt;</li><li>In 
an event items selection dialog a number of event items can be collected to be 
either printed at once or uploaded to a web server. These functions exist alongside 
the existing print and upload functions &lt;1136&gt;</li><li>Through the Event 
item selection dialog publications can be chosen to be used as attachments for 
an e-mail prepared by StageRace &lt;2314&gt; </li><li>For the time trial starting 
order the automatic order generating can now also use the teams classification 
&lt;2314&gt;</li><li>Normal half stage type is now stricter enforced: any entered 
1/xths of seconds are not taken into account anymore (They still exist in the 
Arrival dialog though, to allow for accurately applying group time on imported 
data) &lt;1987&gt;</li><li>Functionality added to allow the user to indicate which 
open document is to be used for the StageRace message protocol (Select active 
document in the View menu) &lt;451&gt;</li></ol><h3> Added Language Features </h3><ol> 
<li value="15">All fixed texts on publications are now available in a Microsoft<sup>&reg;</sup> 
Database (MultiLanguage.mdb) which allows for choosing the publication languages 
on a per-event basis (through the Configure|Settings|Presentation tab sheet) and 
also for providing additional languages, which can be done by end-users, using 
Microsoft<sup>&reg;</sup> Access &lt;451&gt;</li><li>Spanish multilangual captions 
added to the database &lt;2733&gt;</li><li>Path information for referencing MultiLanguage.mdb 
is added for when StageRace runs in an atypical working directory &lt;2314&gt;</li></ol><h3> 
Classifications Generation Improvements </h3><ol> <li value="18">Classification 
generators improved; &quot;last solution&quot; added that provides last resort 
ranking on general classification, for points/sprint/climbing classifications 
&lt;2366&gt;</li><li>Small improvements to classification generators ("so far", 
rather than "all" stages are used) &lt;2341&gt;</li><li>2003 rules implementation 
finished, with depth settings added &lt;2733&gt;</li><li>When intermediately (thus 
before a stage arrival exists) generating sprint and climb classifications, a 
general classification is now generated, although it is not final, because competitors 
that do not finish the race should be excluded. Therefore a 'unofficial' comment 
is added to these classifications &lt;1987&gt;</li><li>Additionally to points 
classification configuration settings entries and a dedicated classification generator 
have been added for the points classification &lt;1737&gt;</li><li>Through the 
half stage configuration dialog the calculation of the teams classification for 
individual half stages can now be set to use only the time of the deciding competitor 
as set in the overall settings of the event &lt;1987&gt;</li></ol><h3> Competitors 
and Teams Improvements </h3><ol> <li value="24">The maximum amount of competitors 
has been dramatically increased from 999 up to 65535 &lt;451&gt;</li><li>A new 
team can now be added from within the dialog for editing a competitor &lt;451&gt;</li><li>Competitors 
starting nos. can be changed now (only when not used in an arrival) &lt;451&gt;</li><li>Starting 
nos. can be edited now in the list view; long-clicking now makes an in-place edit 
box appear for this &lt;1136&gt;</li><li>StageRace (files) can now hold spare 
competitors ("non-active"): competitors without starting no. that exist in the 
software but not can be used in starters lists or classifications until they're 
assigned a start no. and proceed as regular competitors ("active") &lt;1136&gt;</li><li>Active/non-active 
radio buttons have been added to the competitor edit dialog for supporting of 
spare competitors in connection to the starting no. text field &lt;1136&gt;</li><li>Copy 
and Cut funtionality has been added for competitors and teams &lt;451&gt;</li><li>Paste 
functionality has been added for teams, in addition to the existing Paste functionality 
for competitors; both paste functions have been improved slightly and will now 
only ask for confirmation if there is actually something to paste and not longer 
always, as before &lt;451&gt;</li><li>When pasting competitors, necessary teams 
are not longer generated in the background, but for every new team a team edit 
dialog allows for previewing and editing the new team &lt;451&gt;</li><li>Additional 
to earlier fixes, when pasting competitors and choosing for automatically (silently) 
adding new teams, team properties are still prompted for when silent adding would 
result in double team codes &lt;2314&gt;</li><li>Through the Edit menu the starting 
nos. can be grayed out, meaning that starting nos. are ignored when pasting competitors, 
resulting in all pasted competitors to be added as spare competitors &lt;1136&gt;</li><li>Through 
the Edit menu two selected competitors can be swapped in the competitors list 
(exchanging their starting nos.) &lt;1136&gt;</li><li>Competitors and teams count 
is displayed in the event tree now &lt;451&gt; </li></ol><h3> Framework Improvements 
</h3><ol> <li value="37">Files are no longer stored in an encrypted format, because 
it resulted in some vague problems and did not provide any added value anyway. 
Older (encrypted) files are still opened as before while new files are stored 
and opened unencrypted. This should also fix the problem where files could not 
be opened in a french Windows<sup>&reg;</sup> version. Users are alerted when 
an older (encrypted) file is opened and asked to store the file in the new format 
(because every time an old file is opened it can result in some memory loss; worst 
case slightly slowing down the computer during that session of Windows<sup>&reg;</sup>) 
&lt;1737&gt;</li><li>File optimalisation: team pointers removed from arrival class; 
start nos., rankings, orderings and bonuses/points now are unsigned 16-bits variables 
instead of regular integers and all time unit variables now are unsigned 32-bits 
variables instead of long regular integers, throughout the entire software (resulting 
in up to around 29% smaller files) &lt;451&gt;</li><li>All file 'Open'/'Save as' 
dialogs now make differentiations between directories, so that the directories 
that each type of dialog (Open, Save, Import) uses are not showing up in the other 
dialogs as well &lt;1737&gt;</li><li>A confirmation is being asked for now when 
a file is about to be saved in a newer file format &lt;451&gt;</li><li>File save 
dialog on File|New is suppressed now when hardware key is absent &lt;451&gt;</li><li>Password 
encrypted (simple) in the new unencrypted file type &lt;2733&gt;</li><li>Automatic 
build numbering (accessible through the file properties of stagerace.exe) &lt;451&gt;</li><li>Extra 
security added (NPE) &lt;2341&gt;</li></ol><h3> Publications Improvements </h3><ol> 
<li value="45">Printed properties (top of document) and columns (body of document) 
on publications can now be chosen from Settings &lt;1737&gt;</li><li>By adding 
a Generate menu, functions have been made available to switch on and off the automatic 
generation of html publications every time something is changed by the user. Also 
individual or all publications can be generated by choice &lt;1987&gt;</li><li>Individual 
publications can be set to read-only through the Generate menu &lt;2314&gt;</li><li>An 
external publication editor can be invoked for individual publications through 
the Tools menu &lt;2314&gt;</li><li>Document identifier (stage no., description, 
communique no.) is now repeated on every new printed page &lt;1737&gt;</li><li>Main 
(competitors) table now repeats the column headers on every new printed page &lt;1737&gt;</li><li>Dropped 
out competitors can now be printed in a detailed form in the main competitors 
table &lt;1737&gt;</li><li>Signouts have been moved to the main competitors table 
in order to form a more consistent entity with the arrived competitors and the 
dropped out competitors &lt;1737&gt;</li><li>Publication file names have been 
reviewed; in order to reduce the length of the file names, only English and French 
text remain &lt;1770&gt;</li><li>Speeds on publications are now handled nicely 
when no distance or time is available (for instance when during ranking no times 
have been assigned) &lt;1987&gt;</li><li>Possibility added for printing the individual 
competitors that contributed to a certain team's teams classification ranking 
&lt;1987&gt;</li><li>Alignment and use of the event title and the event logo can 
now be chosen from the Settings &lt;1737&gt;</li><li>Various small improvements 
to HTML syntax and layout &lt;1737&gt;</li><li>UCI Code moved rightwards on competitors 
lists (rule 2.2.090) &lt;2314&gt; </li><li>Signouts can no longer be printed on 
half stage communiques &lt;1737&gt; </li><li>All generated files are now forced 
to binary, rather then having this depend on OS settings &lt;2733&gt;</li><li>Advanced 
option "Print background colors and images" from the Windows Internet Options 
has been copied to the StageRace Options dialog &lt;1737&gt;</li></ol><h3> </h3><h3> 
User Interface Improvements </h3><ol> <li value="62">Existing presentation view 
now switches between presentation, competitors list, teams list and empty view, 
based on the chosen tree item. This makes the competitors list dialog and the 
teams list dialog obsolete, which as a result have been removed &lt;451&gt;</li><li>Both 
types of competitors lists are grouped in the main tree view under competitors 
now and not longer divided in competitors and teams &lt;451&gt;</li><li>Every 
view (main tree, presentation, competitors, ...) has its own tool bar now, which 
appears and disappears accordingly to the view being displayed &lt;451&gt;</li><li>Context 
menus have been implemented for the main items tree, the competitors list and 
the teams list &lt;1136&gt;</li><li>Possibility to add a new view to the same 
document. Also additional tile and cascade items added to the Window menu &lt;451&gt;</li><li>Possibility 
to hide the main tree view in a child frame &lt;451&gt;</li><li>Color yellow added 
to the ID view, indicating the particular identifier value proposition is already 
used for another publication &lt;451&gt; </li><li>Status bar support entirely 
redesigned: <ul> <li>Scroll lock indicator removed &lt;451&gt;</li><li>Existing 
presentation view file title and path removed because these were most of the time 
too large anyway to be displayed properly (an Info function has been added to 
the Presentation view now to support this; the IE Properties dialog is invoked 
for this) &lt;451&gt;</li><li>Hardware key indicator added (locked versus free) 
&lt;451&gt;</li><li>Combo box to additionally select and view the active document 
(see elsewhere in this release) &lt;451&gt;</li><li>Indicator for the use of StageRace 
messaging protocol &lt;451&gt;</li></ul></li><li>Additionally to [fix 20] the 
version no. of the currently opened StageRace file is displayed in the status 
bar &lt;1737&gt;Except for the Standard tool bar, tool bars now are attached to 
the child frame &lt;451&gt;</li><li>Expand all tree items &lt;2341&gt;</li><li>Only 
the first child frame window (document) is maximized explicitly now. Ergo, users 
are not longer annoyed by maximized frames if they at some point restore the frame 
windows &lt;451&gt;</li><li>UI interface update handlers have been revised in 
order to prevent unnecessary system load during program idle mode &lt;451&gt;</li><li>Message 
boxes during classification generation are now displayed as topmost windows in 
order not to have them to disappear by the Wait for Classification dialog &lt;1772&gt;</li><li>All 
list views now have normal Windows<sup>&reg;</sup> Explorer cursor and selection 
behavior instead of the hot tracking from before &lt;1136&gt;</li><li>Finish deadline 
edit box in the half stage configuration and underlying members have been removed 
&lt;1136&gt;</li><li>Generalisation of dialog classes and property sheets, providing 
Help shortcut button, Help shortcut key F1, quick drag and bottom banner &lt;451&gt;</li><li>Communique 
dialog made resizable &lt;451&gt;</li><li>Updated tree items, toolbar buttons, 
document and program icons, mdi client area bitmap, etc. &lt;451&gt;</li><li>Applying 
of style guide to all dialogs &lt;451&gt;</li><li>Static images have been centered 
now in order to solve problems with the use of Large fonts (Windows settings, 
Display) &lt;1136&gt;</li><li>Updated splash screen: new logo, system modal tool 
window that always gets the focus from the main frame and returns the focus when 
Go is clicked &lt;451&gt;</li></ol><h3> Added Help Features </h3><ol> <li value="83">Context-sensitive 
help support implemented &lt;2314&gt;</li><li>Context-sensitive help added to 
hardware key warning on start-up &lt;2733&gt;</li><li>Help Search can be invoked 
directly now from the Help menu &lt;451&gt;</li><li>License information is available 
in a nice big window now from within the Help menu &lt;451&gt;</li><li>Tip of 
the Day implemented, working on start up and through the Help menu &lt;1737&gt;</li><li>About 
and Credit dialogs have been upgraded with html views, allowing for nicer and 
more centralised maintenance of their resources &lt;451&gt; </li><li>File reorganisation 
for the about dialog source code &lt;451&gt;</li><li>Credits updated &lt;2733&gt;</li></ol><h3> 
Various Improvements </h3><OL> <li value="91">Improved document/view support and 
OO: <ul> <li>Much functionality has been moved from views to documents &lt;451&gt; 
</li><li>Documents now order views to update (allowing for the possibility to
